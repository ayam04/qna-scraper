        "question": "1. Explain the concept of polymorphism in object-oriented programming.",
        "answer": "Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It refers to the ability of a single interface or method to be implemented in multiple ways. This is depending on the specific class or type of object involved. Polymorphism is a powerful concept in OOP that allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass.",

        "question": "2. How does garbage collection work in Java?",
        "answer": "Garbage collection in Java is an automatic process that manages memory by freeing up space occupied by objects that are no longer in use. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) keeps track of all objects created in the program. Once an object is no longer referenced by any part of the program, it becomes eligible for garbage collection to free up memory resources. The garbage collector identifies these unreachable objects and marks them for collection. During the garbage collection process, the JVM pauses the execution of the program and frees up the memory occupied by the marked objects. This reclaimed memory becomes available for future object allocations. Different garbage collection algorithms are employed to ensure efficient memory management and prevent memory leaks.",

        "question": "3. What is input-output (I/O) in C++?",
        "answer": "In C++, input-output (I/O) refers to the process of exchanging data between a programme and its external environment. It involves showing output data on the screen or writing it to a file after reading input data from the user or a file. The standard libraryâ€™s input and output streams, such cin and cout, are used to implement this capability. For the development of interactive and dynamic programmes, I/O activities are essential.",

        "question": "4. Explain the concepts of OOPS?",
        "answer": "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.\nEncapsulation: It is the bundling of data and methods into a single unit, called an object. Encapsulation provides data security by hiding the internal details of an object and allowing access only through defined interfaces. It helps in achieving code modularity and reusability.\nInheritance: It allows the creation of new classes (derived classes) from existing classes (base classes). Inheritance promotes code reuse and hierarchical organization of classes. Derived classes inherit properties and behaviors from their base classes, enabling the extension and specialisation of functionality.\nPolymorphism: It refers to the ability of objects to take on many forms or respond differently based on the context. Polymorphism allows different objects to be treated as instances of a common superclass, enabling flexibility and extensibility. It is implemented through method overriding and method overloading.\nAbstraction: It focuses on providing essential features while hiding unnecessary details. Abstraction helps in managing complexity by creating simplified models of real-world entities. It allows programmers to work at higher levels of abstraction and deal with objects and operations relevant to the problem domain.",

        "question": "5. What are the different cloud computing service models?",
        "answer": "Cloud computing presents a diverse range of service models to accommodate various user requirements. The key service models include Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).\nIaaS: It provides virtualized computing resources, such as virtual machines, storage, and networks, allowing users to manage and control the infrastructure.\nPaaS: It offers a platform for developing and deploying applications. It provides tools, libraries, and runtime environments,  to focus on application development without worrying about infrastructure management.\nSaaS: delivers software applications over the internet, eliminating the need for installation and allowing users to access applications directly through a web browser. The cloud provider handles all aspects, including infrastructure, platform, and software.",

        "question": "6. Explain the concepts of Static Keyword in Java?",
        "answer": "In Java, the static keyword is used to declare class-level variables and methods that can be accessed without creating an instance of the class. Static members belong to the class itself rather than individual objects. They can be accessed using the class name and are commonly used for utility methods, constants, and shared data.",

        "question": "7. What is the purpose of the Domain Name System (DNS)?",
        "answer": "The Domain Name System (DNS) serves as a crucial component of the internet infrastructure. Its purpose is to translate human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses (such as 192.0.2.1) that computers use to communicate with each other. DNS acts as a decentralised, distributed directory that allows users to access websites, send emails, and perform various online activities without needing to remember complex numerical IP addresses. It plays a vital role in facilitating seamless and efficient communication across the internet.\nGet 100% Hike!\nMaster Most in Demand Skills Now!\nBy providing your contact details, you agree to our Terms of Use & Privacy Policy",
