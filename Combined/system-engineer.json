        "question": "2. Is there a limit to inheritance?",
        "answer": "Indeed, with greater power comes greater complications. As a very powerful feature in OOPs, inheritance has some limitations as well. The inheritance process takes longer to complete as it needs to traverse through multiple classes as part of its implementation. Further, inheritance involves very tight coupling between the base and child classes, so if a change needs to be made, it could involve making nested changes in both classes. As well, inheritance can be difficult to implement, which, if not done correctly, could lead to unexpected errors and incorrect results. Conclusion As smart mechatronic products have become more and more prevalent, the field of systems engineering has grown to become one of the most significant jobs in the world. Almost every major industry employs a systems engineer, from health care to transportation to manufacturing to software.
