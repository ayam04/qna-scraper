        "question": "5. What is LINQ? How is it used in SharePoint?",
        "answer": "LINQ is a feature of the programming languages C# 3.0 and Visual Basic .NET. LINQ allows a user to query in an object-oriented way, supports compile-time check, gives the user IntelliSense support in Visual Studio, and defines a unified, SQL-like syntax to query any data source. However, unlike other languages and query syntaxes which vary from one type of data source to another, LINQ can be used to query, in principle, any data source. Hence, developers may find that it is the only query syntax that they ever need to know. It is commonly used to query objects, collections, XML, and SQL server data sources.\nLINQ to SharePoint is officially being supported with the 2010 release. It works similar to LINQ to SQL or LINQ to Entity.\nThe LINQ to SharePoint Provider is defined in the Microsoft.SharePoint.Linq namespace. It translates LINQ queries into Collaborative Application Markup Language (CAML) queries. The gateway class for the LINQ to SharePoint provider is Microsoft SharePoint.Linq.DataContext which represents the data of a SharePoint Foundation website.\nInterested in learning Microsoft Azure?

        "answer": "The key limitation of the SSP architecture was that it was configured by using a set of services, and all web applications associated with the SSP bore the overhead of all the services even if they weren’t being used. To change the service configuration for a particular web application, a new SSP would have to be created.\nThe service application architecture, on the other hand, allows a set of services to be associated with a given web application and a different set of services to be associated with another web application. Also, the same service application can be configured differently in different web applications; therefore, websites can be configured to use only the services that are needed, rather than the entire bank of services.\nAre you interested in learning Azure from experts?

SharePoint may also be used as a central portal for information interchange and task collaboration, and the user experience can be customized for each user.\nSharePoint allows you to manage your content: SharePoint includes a robust content management tool that functions similarly to an electronic document library. Imagine all of the paper files packed in filing cabinets throughout many rooms, making it hard to discover anything without sifting through mountains of paper! SharePoint's electronic document management feature provides a central area for electronic files to be stored. By logging into the SharePoint site, members of an organization can also import documents so that files can be shared with all members. Members can also work on the same document collaboratively, make edits, and view revision history, allowing them to multitask in a mobile work environment.\nInsight into the business world: SharePoint allows users to read and edit Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files directly from a web browser, as well as use the sophisticated features of Microsoft Office apps.

There are a maximum of five zones per Web application. Following are the different types of zones available: Intranet\nInternet\nCustom\nExtranet\nExtranet Intranet Internet Custom Extranet Extranet The Default zone is generated when you create a Web application. The Web application can then be extended to create additional zones. Per Web application, each zone can only be selected once. In a Web application, for example, there can only be one Default zone. In Internet Information Services (IIS), each zone is represented by a separate Web site. The key distinction is that after extending SharePoint, each zone has its own IIS Website. These zones have unique URLs assigned to them. Each zone has its own port number and protocol (HTTP or HTTPS). In each zone, several authentication methods can be used to log in. For example, intranet forms authentication, default Windows authentication, and so on. For each zone, you configure your Blob and Distributed cache differently. For example - Assume you have a building, which is your Web Application, with a default zone as its main entrance and its own authentication service, such as Windows authentication in the front for SharePoint administrators, and adding other zones is similar to adding a few additional entrances to your Web Application with Facebook as the identity provider for your federated partners.

These forms can be used to allow users to set parameters and other information for the workflow ahead of time. Initiation forms discuss how the workflow relates to a specific SharePoint item, whereas association forms address how the workflow applies to a given list, library, or content category.\nAdministrators are presented with association forms when they initially select to associate a process with a specific list, document library, or content category. You can use association forms to allow an administrator to set workflow parameters, default values, and other information for items on the list, library, or content type with which the administrator is associating it.\nWhen users begin a workflow on a specific SharePoint item, they are presented with an initiation form. Initiation forms can be used to allow users to modify or append the association parameters provided by administrators, as well as to specify extra parameters or information about the workflow as it relates to a specific SharePoint item. Initiation forms aren't required for all workflows.\nThe initiation form and the association form can be the same. Using the same form for each workflow form, for example, allows administrators to define some default values during workflow association, then let the user who begins the workflow instance on a specific item review and replaces those default options.\nModification forms:\nYou might wish to give your users the ability to change the workflow while it's running on an item. For example, you could wish to give a user the ability to delegate a task to someone else or even add a new activity to the workflow. Modifications are the options you give users to adjust the process while it's executing on an item. You can construct modification forms that allow users to provide modification parameters.\nTask forms:\nFor each task in your process, you can provide custom forms. However, because tasks are SharePoint items with a content type assigned to them, the task type's custom forms are determined by the content type. All SharePoint task types are allocated content types by default. If a task type does not have a content type assigned to it, the task type is given the Task base content type. The WorkflowTask foundation content type must be used for all task-type content types. A content type's custom new, edit, and display forms can be specified. When displaying a workflow task, Microsoft SharePoint Foundation uses any custom forms you've created for the relevant task content type. Association and Initiation forms:\nBefore each workflow begins, users are presented with association and initiation forms to complete. These forms can be used to allow users to set parameters and other information for the workflow ahead of time. Initiation forms discuss how the workflow relates to a specific SharePoint item, whereas association forms address how the workflow applies to a given list, library, or content category.\nAdministrators are presented with association forms when they initially select to associate a process with a specific list, document library, or content category. You can use association forms to allow an administrator to set workflow parameters, default values, and other information for items on the list, library, or content type with which the administrator is associating it.\nWhen users begin a workflow on a specific SharePoint item, they are presented with an initiation form. Initiation forms can be used to allow users to modify or append the association parameters provided by administrators, as well as to specify extra parameters or information about the workflow as it relates to a specific SharePoint item.

        "question": "11. What do you understand about workflows in the context of Microsoft SharePoint?",
        "answer": "A workflow is a natural approach to arrange and operate a collection of work units, or activities, into a single executable file that represents a work process. This method can manage practically every aspect of a SharePoint Foundation object, including its life cycle. The workflow is adaptable enough to model both system functions and human actions required to complete the workflow. Workflows can be as simple or as complex as required by your business processes. You can construct workflows that the user starts or workflows that SharePoint Foundation initiates automatically based on an event, such as the creation or modification of an object. Workflows are used to define custom business processes.",

        "answer": "Following are the advantages of using Microsoft SharePoint : Built-in multi-purpose functionality: The main advantage of SharePoint is its adaptability. The collaborative platform functions as an intranet, which is a company's internal website for sharing information, work schedules, contacts, and other functions.\nDepending on the user's status, administrators can award different permission levels. Aside from that, the software has features for document sharing, file management, social networking, business information, and nearly everything else related to your company's day-to-day operations.\nCentralized Administration: One of the most important SharePoint 2010 advantages is the ease with which it can be managed. On a single dashboard, administrators may rapidly access operating functions including security settings, coll, back up sites and site data, execute restorations, and adjust rights.\nModifiable: You can use the basic online SharePoint features and benefits or customize them to meet your specific business requirements. In each of the Microsoft SharePoint features, your team will be able to create custom elements. You may also use the drag and drop functions to change the entire app's UI to reflect your branding and improve employees' perceptions of the app.\nCollaboration and document management: Microsoft SharePoint 2013 allows you to organize and make your company's information more accessible. SharePoint's main features include a faster information flow and cloud storage that can be accessed from mobile devices. Employees who are well-informed make better decisions, fulfil deadlines, and understand and contribute to the company's overall plan. On SharePoint, sharing files is as simple as clicking or touching a button. Yes, one of SharePoint 2013's many advantages is mobility.\nConsolidation of the applications: You can consolidate all of your sites (shared work environments) into a single platform, reducing the costs of siloed site management. Internal teams can simply access and manage the internet and intranet sites because they have been consolidated.\nIntegration with your current applications: Microsoft SharePoint integrates seamlessly with your other business apps. Microsoft Office Suite (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint), MS Unified Communications, MS Exchange Server, ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), CRM (Customer Relationship Management), and many other back-office systems and previous versions are all compatible with the product. Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer aren't the only browsers that operate with SharePoint Online; all of the modern web browsers are supported.\nImproved security: The Advanced security measures incorporated in SharePoint helps to limit the risk of outages and illegal access. Among the new features are improvements to workflow and authentication. Despite the fact that information access and shareability have been enhanced, your data integrity is preserved. At the document or item level, further security configurations and access/editing privileges can be defined. Organizations that manage sensitive data can benefit from the collaboration application as well. To help you comply with your industry's data security regulatory standards, you can select different options for managing shareability, storage, and auditing.\nDesign assistance and ease of usage: Because Microsoft SharePoint 2010 features and benefits include the capacity to construct solutions that better meet your business demands, you won't need to hire a team of web developers to update your website or create database management systems. The application programming interfaces (APIS) for such jobs are available in SharePoint Online and SharePoint Server. Using SharePoint development features to create apps is a great approach to save money.\nContent administration: You may prepare and schedule content for publication on a variety of websites and social media channels. SharePoint 2013's social networking features make it simple to share ideas, updates, and content. Users can upload Office documents to the platform and share them with others within and outside the company. They can also create and edit tasks from any device, as well as convert documents between different formats such as PDF, Word, and Excel.\nStreamline and speed up the business process: Using a collaboration platform like Microsoft SharePoint, data can be collected and organized in one location. Form-driven SharePoint apps collect data from suppliers, connect with customers, and collaborate with partners and others.

        "question": "2. What do you understand about the 5000 item limit threshold in the context of Microsoft SharePoint? How can you overcome the issue of the 5000 item limit threshold?",
        "answer": "The 5,000 view restriction on the document library was introduced by Microsoft with SharePoint 2010 for one reason: to keep the document library and its servers running smoothly. When the limit was reached in the past, the traditional library became unusable. However, SharePoint can now handle massive amounts of data thanks to Microsoft's modern interface and new document library. Even though you can now upload more than 20,000 papers without the library freezing, the browsing limit remains. Let's imagine you have a document library with 10,000 files in it, all of them are in the same folder. You won't be able to see more than 5,000 items on the page if you go to that library because the query will hit the limit. A large document library will cause you trouble in addition to not being able to see all of the contents. The majority of operations, such as renaming a folder or moving files within the library, will take a long time. Following are the different ways in which you can fix the 5000 item limit threshold issue in Microsoft SharePoint : Reduce the number of items to under 5,000.\nThe first step is to reduce the number of items in your inventory down below the item viewing threshold. When the number of items in your library hits that limit, you will be unable to create trivial actions in your library.\nYou won't be able to do any of the following:\nManage column indexes\nAdd columns\nAdjust the views\nSet permissions Reduce the number of items to under 5,000.\nThe first step is to reduce the number of items in your inventory down below the item viewing threshold.

Reorganize Your Library in Its Entirety\nYou can organize your items by moving them into separate libraries and categorizing them based on business functions. You can, on the other hand, delete items that are no longer useful. You'll run across this problem again in the near future unless you reorganize your entire library. As a result, you must follow solid organizational procedures and make use of as many libraries as possible.\nMetadata Properties are created.\nIt's time to build metadata properties and apply default column values to folders in your current library after you've reorganized everything. Give as much information as possible about each item you have. You can now index columns after you've done that. As previously said, this allows your server to query the index catalogs rather than search each item. This method is more efficient and will put less strain on the server. You can, on the other hand, choose to conceal specific folders entirely from view. Some people don't require access to particular folders, so you can set it up to conceal it from them or limit the number of items they can see.

It is Microsoft's web-based collaborative software for generating and maintaining web pages, which is primarily promoted as a content management system for document and storage management.\nIt is a wiki platform for uploading documents with integrated JIRA (Jira software and Jira service desk) and HipChat, as well as an easy-to-use document version control collaboration tool. It is a document management application that integrates with Microsoft Office and other Microsoft tools like ERP, CRM, and more to manage, organize, and save data. This is intuitive and simple to use for document management and navigation, with attractive designs.\nFor minimum reliance on any professional service business, high standardization settings are offered. There are no such configurations for dependencies accessible in this, thus it must be customized.\nConfluence has built-in document version management, which allows us to restore erased history by using a version number that is updated each time the document is edited or altered, and which is tagged to the document. SharePoint can also restore erased history or document or file modifications by enabling versioning, which allows it to trace the history and determine which document or item has been changed. It can also be used to restore past versions of SharePoint libraries or lists.\nThis lacks a public-facing site publishing feature, as well as a chat feature, which Atlassians are working on. This comes with extra features including intranet sites for publishing public-facing web pages, chat functionality, and a comprehensive data warehouse for storing large amounts of data.\nBy default, collaborative editing is enabled for editing documents that are automatically saved and can be edited by several people at the same time. Both server-based and cloud-based solutions are supported. In SharePoint, collaborative editing is done directly via document libraries in both browsers and apps, where numerous users can edit at the same time, which is known as co-authoring. This applies to both server-based and cloud-based solutions.\nThis works well since it is simple to use, even when there is a team, and it allows for quick sharing of files, PDFs, photos, and other documents, as well as inline commenting, so there is no mess while working. Because there are more people in the team, this program is a little more difficult to use than Confluence; this software will be tough to deal with as it becomes more sophisticated.\nThis is utilized in project management, and it works well in small businesses employing document management solutions, therefore it's popular among developers. This is also more practical and popular for project management because it gathers all project data in one location, allowing users to standardize their delivery and increase visibility.\nConfluence is best suited for small to mid-sized businesses, but not for large organizations. SharePoint works well for businesses of all sizes, from small businesses to large corporations.\nSkype, Netflix, Facebook, LinkedIn, Adobe, NASA, and other companies are among Confluence's customers.

        "answer": "Following are the different types of SharePoint Add-ins : SharePoint hosted add-ins:\nIn an add-in web, SharePoint-hosted add-ins are virtually exclusively made up of SharePoint components. They're believed to have their heart in SharePoint at times. A user can execute a SharePoint-hosted add-in from a tile on the Site Contents page of the SharePoint website where it's installed, just like any other SharePoint Add-in. Add-in parts and custom actions are two further types of UI components that can be included in the host site (that is, custom ribbon buttons or menu items). The add-in web is where everything else in a SharePoint-hosted add-in is deployed. A SharePoint-hosted add-in's business logic is written in JavaScript, either directly on a custom page or in a JavaScript file linked from a custom page. A JavaScript version of the SharePoint object model (JSOM) is supplied to make CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) actions on SharePoint data simple for the add-in.\nProvider hosted add-ins:\nA provider-hosted add-in can contain any SharePoint component that can be found in a SharePoint-hosted add-in. However, provider-hosted add-ins differ from SharePoint-hosted add-ins in that they involve at least one remote component that is hosted outside of the SharePoint farm or SharePoint Online subscription, such as a web application, service, or database. This could be a server on the same corporate network as a SharePoint farm or a cloud service.

        "question": "7. What do you understand about add-ins in the context of Microsoft SharePoint?",
        "answer": "A SharePoint Add-in is a self-contained piece of functionality that expands SharePoint websites' capabilities to tackle a specific business need. Custom code that runs on SharePoint servers is not present in add-ins. Instead, all custom logic is moved \"up\" to the cloud, \"down\" to client computers, or \"over\" to an on-premises server that is not part of the SharePoint farm or subscription. SharePoint administrators may rest assured that the add-in will neither harm their servers or degrade the performance of their SharePoint Online websites by keeping custom code off of them. One of the various client APIs offered in SharePoint allows business logic in a SharePoint Add-in to access SharePoint data. Which API you pick for your add-in is determined by a number of additional design considerations. A SharePoint Add-in can include almost all major types of SharePoint components, such as pages, lists, workflows, custom content types, list templates, web parts, and more. Host webs are SharePoint websites on which SharePoint Add-ins are installed and from which users launch them. The SharePoint components, on the other hand, are usually located in an add-in web, which is a specific child web of the host web. SharePoint Add-ins can be integrated into a SharePoint site in a variety of ways : As a full-page immersive experience with the appearance and feel of a SharePoint page.

As UI commands for lists, documents, and more than augment ribbons and menus. As UI commands for lists, documents, and more than augment ribbons and menus.   On the Site Contents page of the SharePoint website, any SharePoint Add-ins that users install are given a tile. The add-in is launched by clicking the tile. An add-in manifest—an XML file that describes the add-fundamental in's properties, where it runs, and what SharePoint should do when the add-in starts—is used to set up a SharePoint Add-in. The manifest can indicate what languages the add-in supports, what SharePoint services and capabilities it relies on, and what permissions the add-in requires on the host web, among other things.

OneDrive does not allow you to publish your files to the internet. While you can email links to documents, the OneDrive platform does not allow you to publish those documents directly to a web page. You can share documents with your team, but if you want to publish your work publicly, you'll need Microsoft 365 or another CMS/website platform.",

        "question": "10. What do you understand about SharePoint farm?",
        "answer": "  Simply said, a SharePoint farm is a group of servers that collaborate to fill SharePoint responsibilities and make SharePoint function. If you're unfamiliar with the concept, consider roles to be separate jobs that each demand specific talents. When you're ready to install SharePoint, you assign one or more roles to each server on your farm. A team working together toward the same objective is a good illustration of roles. Consider a restaurant staff. In a restaurant, the host seats customers, the waiter takes their orders and eventually delivers their meal, and the kitchen crew prepares the food. If the host is removed, the patron will never be seated. When a waiter is lost, the customer is unable to place an order, eat, or simply receive a poor glass of water. Of course, one person may fulfil all of those tasks — for example, at a small coffee shop, where the person behind the counter takes your order, advises you to sit wherever you choose, and then butters and delivers your toast. This only works if the venue isn't too crowded since that one individual would quickly become overwhelmed. Your farm servers operate in the same way, with a single server capable of performing all duties or spreading them across numerous servers for improved performance. There are three roles in SharePoint (formally defined in the SharePoint installation wizard alongside a few new roles in SharePoint Server 2016). three roles They are as follows: The Web Front End (WFE), Application Server, and Database Server.",
