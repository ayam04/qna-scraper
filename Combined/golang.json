        "answer": "Yes. Multiple values can be returned in Golang by sending comma-separated values with the return statement and by assigning it to multiple variables in a single statement as shown in the example below: package main\nimport (\n \"fmt\"\n)\n\nfunc reverseValues(a,b string)(string, string){\n    return b,a    //notice how multiple values are returned\n}\n\nfunc main(){\n    val1,val2:= reverseValues(\"interview\",\"bit\")    // notice how multiple values are assigned\n    fmt.Println(val1, val2)\n} package main\nimport (\n \"fmt\"\n)\n\nfunc reverseValues(a,b string)(string, string){\n    return b,a    //notice how multiple values are returned\n}\n\nfunc main(){\n    val1,val2:= reverseValues(\"interview\",\"bit\")    // notice how multiple values are assigned\n    fmt.Println(val1, val2)\n} In the above example, we have a function reverseValues which simply returns the inputs in reverse order. In the main goroutine, we call the reverseValues function and the values are assigned to values val1 and val2 in one statement. The output of the code would be bit interview bit interview",

        "answer": "Go language follows the principle of maximum effect with minimum efforts. Every feature and syntax of Go was developed to ease the life of programmers. Following are the advantages of Go Language: Simple and Understandable: Go is very simple to learn and understand. There are no unnecessary features included. Every single line of the Go code is very easily readable and thereby easily understandable irrespective of the size of the codebase. Go was developed by keeping simplicity, maintainability and readability in mind.\nStandard Powerful Library: Go supports all standard libraries and packages that help in writing code easily and efficiently.\nSupport for concurrency: Go provides very good support for concurrency using Go Routines or channels. They take advantage of efficient memory management strategies and multi-core processor architecture for implementing concurrency.\nStatic Type Checking: Go is a very strong and statically typed programming language. Statically typed means every variable has types assigned to it. The data type cannot be changed once created and strongly typed means that there are rules and restrictions while performing type conversion. This ensures that the code is type-safe and all type conversions are handled efficiently. This is done for reducing the chances of errors at runtime.\nEasy to install Binaries: Go provides support for generating binaries for the applications with all required dependencies. These binaries help to install tools or applications written in Go very easily without the need for a Go compiler or package managers or runtimes.\nGood Testing Support: Go has good support for writing unit test cases along with our code.

Pointers support two operators: * operator: This operator is called a dereferencing operator and is used for accessing the value in the address stored by the pointer.\n& operator: This operator is called the address operator and is used for returning the address of the variable stored in the pointer. * operator: This operator is called a dereferencing operator and is used for accessing the value in the address stored by the pointer. * * operator: & operator: This operator is called the address operator and is used for returning the address of the variable stored in the pointer. & & operator: This is illustrated in the diagram below. Here, consider we have a variable x assigned to 100. We store x in the memory address 0x0201. Now, when we create a pointer of the name Y for the variable x, we assign the value as &x for storing the address of variable x. The pointer variable is stored in address 0x0208. Now to get the value stored in the address that is stored in the pointer, we can just write int z:= *Y &x int z:= *Y   Pointers are used for the following purposes: Allowing function to directly mutate value passed to it. That is achieving pass by reference functionality.\nFor increasing the performance in the edge cases in the presence of a large data structure. Using pointers help to copy large data efficiently.\nHelps in signifying the lack of values.

This is executed only once at the beginning of the loop. This is done for declaring and initializing the loop control variables. This field is optional as long as we have initialized the loop control variables before. If we are not doing anything here, the semicolon needs to be present.\nThe condition is then evaluated. If the condition is satisfied, the loop body is executed.\nIf the condition is not satisfied, the control flow goes to the next statement after the for loop.\nIf the condition is satisfied and the loop body is executed, then the control goes back to the increment statement which updated the loop control variables.

        "answer": "A goroutine is nothing but a function in Golang that usually runs concurrently or parallelly with other functions. They can be imagined as a lightweight thread that has independent execution and can run concurrently with other routines. Goroutines are entirely managed by Go Runtime. Goroutines help Golang achieve concurrency. In Golang, the main function of the main package is considered the main goroutine. It is the starting point of all other goroutines. These goroutines have the power to start their goroutines. Once the execution of the main goroutine is complete, it means that the program has been completed.\nWe can start a goroutine by just specifying the go keyword before the method call. The method will now be called and run as a goroutine. Consider an example below: In Golang, the main function of the main package is considered the main goroutine. It is the starting point of all other goroutines. These goroutines have the power to start their goroutines. Once the execution of the main goroutine is complete, it means that the program has been completed. We can start a goroutine by just specifying the go keyword before the method call.

When a function is called a goroutine, the call will be returned immediately to the next line of the program statement which is why “Started Main” would be printed first and the goroutine will be scheduled and run concurrently in the background. The sleep statement ensures that the goroutine is scheduled before the completion of the main goroutine. The output of this code would be: Started Main\nInside Sample Goroutine\nFinished Main Started Main\nInside Sample Goroutine\nFinished Main",

Slice has 3 components: Pointer: This is used for pointing to the first element of the array accessible via slice.

Capacity: For example: Consider an array of name arr having the values “This”,“is”, “a”,“Go”,“interview”,“question”. package main\n \nimport \"fmt\"\n \nfunc main() {\n \n    // Creating an array\n    arr := [6]string{\"This\",\"is\", \"a\",\"Go\",\"interview\",\"question\"}\n \n    // Print array\n    fmt.Println(\"Original Array:\", arr)\n \n    // Create a slice\n    slicedArr := arr[1:4]\n \n    // Display slice\n    fmt.Println(\"Sliced Array:\", slicedArr)\n \n    // Length of slice calculated using len()\n    fmt.Println(\"Length of the slice: %d\", len(slicedArr))\n \n    // Capacity of slice calculated using cap()\n    fmt.Println(\"Capacity of the slice: %d\", cap(slicedArr))\n} package main\n \nimport \"fmt\"\n \nfunc main() {\n \n    // Creating an array\n    arr := [6]string{\"This\",\"is\", \"a\",\"Go\",\"interview\",\"question\"}\n \n    // Print array\n    fmt.Println(\"Original Array:\", arr)\n \n    // Create a slice\n    slicedArr := arr[1:4]\n \n    // Display slice\n    fmt.Println(\"Sliced Array:\", slicedArr)\n \n    // Length of slice calculated using len()\n    fmt.Println(\"Length of the slice: %d\", len(slicedArr))\n \n    // Capacity of slice calculated using cap()\n    fmt.Println(\"Capacity of the slice: %d\", cap(slicedArr))\n} Here, we are trying to slice the array to get only the first 3 words starting from the word at the first index from the original array.

        "question": "13. What are Go Interfaces?",
        "answer": "Go interfaces are those that have a defined set of method signatures. It is a custom type who can take values that has these methods implementation.  The interfaces are abstract which is why we cannot create its instance. But we can create a variable of type interface and that variable can then be assigned to a concrete value that has methods required by the interface. Due to these reasons, an interface can act as two things: Collection of method signatures\nCustom types Collection of method signatures Custom types They are created by using the type keyword followed by the name needed for the interface and finally followed by the keyword interface. The syntax goes as follows: type interface type name_of_interface interface{\n\n// Method signatures\n\n} type name_of_interface interface{\n\n// Method signatures\n\n} Consider an example of creating an interface of the name “golangInterfaceDemo” having two methods demo_func1() and demo_func2(). The interface will be defined as: // Create an interface\ntype golangInterfaceDemo interface{\n    // Methods\n    demo_func1() int\n    demo_func2() float64\n} // Create an interface\ntype golangInterfaceDemo interface{\n    // Methods\n    demo_func1() int\n    demo_func2() float64\n} Interface also promotes abstraction. In Golang, we can use interfaces for creating common abstractions which can be used by multiple types by defining method declarations that are compatible with the interface. Conside the following example: package main\n \nimport \"fmt\"\n \n// \"Triangle\" data type\ntype Triangle struct {\n base, height float32\n}\n \n// \"Square\" data type\ntype Square struct {\n length float32\n}\n \n// \"Rectangle\" data type\ntype Rectangle struct {\n length, breadth float32\n}\n \n// To calculate area of triangle\nfunc (triangle Triangle) Area() float32 {\n return 0.5 * triangle.base * triangle.height\n}\n \n// To calculate area of square\nfunc (square Square) Area() float32 {\n return square.length * square.length\n}\n \n// To calculate area of rectangle\nfunc (rect Rectangle) Area() float32 {\n return rect.length * rect.breadth\n}\n \n// Area interface for achieving abstraction\ntype Area interface {\n Area() float32\n}\n \nfunc main() {\n // Declare and assign values to varaibles\n triangleObject := Triangle{base: 20, height: 10}\n squareobject := Square{length: 25}\n rectObject := Rectangle{length: 15, breadth: 20}\n \n // Define a variable of type interface\n var shapeObject Area\n \n // Assign to \"Triangle\" type variable to the Area interface\n shapeObject = triangleObject\n fmt.Println(\"Triangle Area = \", shapeObject.Area())\n \n // Assign to \"Square\" type variable to the Area interface\n shapeObject = squareobject\n fmt.Println(\"Square Area = \", shapeObject.Area())\n \n // Assign to \"Rectangle\" type variable to the Area interface\n shapeObject = rectObject\n fmt.Println(\"Rectangle Area = \", shapeObject.Area())\n} package main\n \nimport \"fmt\"\n \n// \"Triangle\" data type\ntype Triangle struct {\n base, height float32\n}\n \n// \"Square\" data type\ntype Square struct {\n length float32\n}\n \n// \"Rectangle\" data type\ntype Rectangle struct {\n length, breadth float32\n}\n \n// To calculate area of triangle\nfunc (triangle Triangle) Area() float32 {\n return 0.5 * triangle.base * triangle.height\n}\n \n// To calculate area of square\nfunc (square Square) Area() float32 {\n return square.length * square.length\n}\n \n// To calculate area of rectangle\nfunc (rect Rectangle) Area() float32 {\n return rect.length * rect.breadth\n}\n \n// Area interface for achieving abstraction\ntype Area interface {\n Area() float32\n}\n \nfunc main() {\n // Declare and assign values to varaibles\n triangleObject := Triangle{base: 20, height: 10}\n squareobject := Square{length: 25}\n rectObject := Rectangle{length: 15, breadth: 20}\n \n // Define a variable of type interface\n var shapeObject Area\n \n // Assign to \"Triangle\" type variable to the Area interface\n shapeObject = triangleObject\n fmt.Println(\"Triangle Area = \", shapeObject.Area())\n \n // Assign to \"Square\" type variable to the Area interface\n shapeObject = squareobject\n fmt.Println(\"Square Area = \", shapeObject.Area())\n \n // Assign to \"Rectangle\" type variable to the Area interface\n shapeObject = rectObject\n fmt.Println(\"Rectangle Area = \", shapeObject.Area())\n} In the above example, we have created 3 types for the shapes triangle, square and rectangle. We have also defined 3 Area() functions that calculate the area of the shapes based on the input object type passed. We have also defined an interface named Area and we have defined the method signature Area() within it. In the main function, we are creating the objects, assigning each object to the interface and calculating the area by calling the method declared in the interface. Here, we need not know specifically about the function that needs to be called. The interface method will take care of this considering the object type. This is called abstraction. The output of the above code will be: Triangle Area =  100\nSquare Area =  625\nRectangle Area =  300 Triangle Area =  100\nSquare Area =  625\nRectangle Area =  300",

Maps provide faster access in terms of O(1) complexity to the values if the key is known. A map is visualized as shown in the image below:   Once the values are stored in key-value pairs in the map, we can retrieve the object by using the key as map_name[key_name] and we can check if the key, say “foo”, is present or not and then perform some operations by using the below code: map_name[key_name] if val, isExists := map_obj[\"foo\"]; isExists {\n    //do steps needed here\n} if val, isExists := map_obj[\"foo\"]; isExists {\n    //do steps needed here\n} From the above code, we can see that two variables are being initialized. The val variable would get the value corresponding to the key “foo” from the map. If no value is present, we get “zero value” and the other variable isExists will get a bool value that will be set to true if the key “foo” is present in the map else false. Then the isExists condition is evaluated, if the value is true, then the body of the if would be executed.",

The syntax of Type Assertion is: t := i.(T) t := i.(T) Here, the statement asserts that the interface value i has the concrete type T and assigns the value of type T to the variable t. In case i does not have concrete type T, then the statement will result in panic. For testing, if an interface has the concrete type, we can do it by making use of two values returned by type assertion. One value is the underlying value and the other is a bool value that tells if the assertion is completed or not. The syntax would be: t, isSuccess := i.(T) t, isSuccess := i.(T) Here, if the interface value i have T, then the underlying value will be assigned to t and the value of isSuccess becomes true. Else, the isSuccess statement would be false and the value of t would have the zero value corresponding to type T. This ensures there is no panic if the assertion fails.",

The function should return an error as its return variable if things go wrong. The caller has to check this error value and identify the error. Any value other than nil is termed as an error. As part of good error handling practices, guard classes should be used over if-else statements. They should also be wrapped in a meaningful way as they can be passed up in the call stack.

Companies have recognized the scope and benefits of Golang and have started to adapt to this language. Some of the notable companies that have already shifted to Golang are Google, Apple, Facebook, Docker, BBC etc. Furthermore, Golang has raised the excitement level of developers in the open-source community as it’s been a while since a new language for the backend has been created. Due to these reasons, the scope of Golang is growing rapidly. According to the data in Golang Cafe from 2021, the average salary of golang developers in India starts from ₹819,565 to ₹1,617,391 per annum. The prospects and benefits are amazing!
