However, the company needs to divide the network into smaller subnetworks to accommodate different departments. How will you respond to this situation?",
        "answer": "In this case, subnetting allows the company to create smaller subnets within the main network. Let’s say the company wants to create four subnets, each accommodating 50 devices.\nTo subnet the network, the company can borrow additional bits from the host portion of the IP address. In this example, borrowing 2 bits will provide 4 subnets (2^2 = 4). The remaining 6 bits in the host portion will allow 62 usable IP addresses per subnet (2^6 – 2 = 62, accounting for the network address and broadcast address in each subnet).\nAfter subnetting, the network might look as follows:\nSubnet 1:\nNetwork address: 192.168.0.0/26\nFirst usable IP address: 192.168.0.1\nLast usable IP address: 192.168.0.62\nBroadcast address: 192.168.0.63\nSubnet 2:\nNetwork address: 192.168.0.64/26\nFirst usable IP address: 192.168.0.65\nLast usable IP address: 192.168.0.126\nBroadcast address: 192.168.0.127\nSubnet 3:\nNetwork address: 192.168.0.128/26\nFirst usable IP address: 192.168.0.129\nLast usable IP address: 192.168.0.190\nBroadcast address: 192.168.0.191\nSubnet 4:\nNetwork address: 192.168.0.192/26\nFirst usable IP address: 192.168.0.193\nLast usable IP address: 192.168.0.254\nBroadcast address: 192.168.0.255\nBy subnetting the network, the company can allocate specific IP address ranges to different departments or teams while ensuring efficient utilization of IP addresses.
