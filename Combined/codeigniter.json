You can pass an array from the controller to view in CodeIgniter using below given steps: Create a view: Create a view: Create a view: Create a new text file and name it ciblogview.php. Save the created file in the application/views/ directory. Open the ciblogview.php file and add the below-given code to it: ciblogview.php application/views/ ciblogview.php <html>\n<head>\n   <title>Blog</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n   <h1>Welcome to Blog in CodeIgniter</h1>\n</body>\n</html> <html>\n<head>\n   <title>Blog</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n   <h1>Welcome to Blog in CodeIgniter</h1>\n</body>\n</html> Load the view: Load the view: Load the view: Loading a view is executed using the following syntax: $this->load->view('name'); $this->load->view('name'); Where ‘name’ represents the name of the view.

        "answer": "The CodeIgniter application is based on the MVC (Model – View – Controller) model, which separates the application logic from the presentation view. Because of presentation view separation from the PHP scripting, it allows your web pages for script minimization.   Model:\nGenerally, a model is used for database interaction. When a user raises a request for the specific data from the application, the model takes the accountability to fetch out the records from the database table.\nAlso, a data structure represented by the model can be used to perform several operations like retrieve, insert, update, and delete.\nController:\nThe working of the CodeIgniter application is controlled by the controller. It acts as an intermediary for the communication between the model and the view. Therefore, it has the accountability to receive the user request and handle that request by furnishing a result generated by the model. The appropriate records will be displayed to the user by using the view component. (Note: The Controller file name and class name should be the same and must be in uppercase letters. Example- Main.php)\nView:\nTypically, a view is similar to a web page that has the information displayed to the user. A view can also be an integral part of a web page such as header and footer. The view page can be represented in both RSS(RDF Site Summary) and a user interface. Model:\nGenerally, a model is used for database interaction.

This hidden field is considered as CSRF token, it is a random value that changes with each HTTP request sent. After gets inserted into the website forms, it will be saved in the user’s session as well. So, when the user submits the form, the website checks whether it is the same as the one that was saved in the session. If it is the same then, the request is authorized.",

Conclusion:\nCodeIgniter has become the predominant choice of interest for developers while creating websites. Even though there are plenty of other choices when considering the right programming framework for the applications, CodeIgniter has gained its own preference in the market. The sole reason that most of the developers are choosing it is because of the several advantages that it offers to the people. Conclusion:  Freedcamp, Nissan, Bonfire, Buffer, etc. are some of the websites that use the CodeIgniter framework. There is a great amount of demand for PHP developers with CodeIgniter skills. This set of interview questions will definitely help you excel in the CodeIgniter job interview. We hope these interview questions and answers on CodeIgniter will assist you to crack the relevant interview.

        "answer": "Few advantages of using CodeIgniter is given below: Built-in libraries: It comes with various types of default helpers for multiple things including strings, arrays, cookies, directories, file handling, and forms among others.\nData abstraction: You can make use of the CodeIgniter database abstraction layer for creating, adding, deleting, and replacing statements in a hassle-free manner. This framework allows you to manage multiple connections using a single application.\nActive Developer Community: Bigger the community, the better the help you get. Newly graduated developers look forward to the framework’s forum to get their doubts solved and learn about new things in the process. With so many people actively participating in it from around the world, your doubts will be solved within few hours. And due to the same reason, CodeIgniter documentation is 10 times bigger than any other framework.\nCollaboration with Expression Engine: The collaboration permits developers using CodeIgniter to use libraries and everything else provided by Expression Engine and vice versa. Because of this, developers will get few benefits like better parser class, improved built-in user authentication, and easy access to modular applications.\nSecurity: The security strength modification can be done according to your client’s needs. These changes are made when the system is initialized by switching off the magic_quotes_runtime directive irrespective of the register_globals directive. You don’t need to remove the slashes during information retrieval from the database. You can enable encryption of cookies, where you can handle databases and escape SQL queries directly.\nImmigration Features: Database schema update management is easier over different fields by using the migration aspect. It is an easier process to immigrate from the server to the server in Codeigniter.\nEasy to Use: It is easier to use compared to other popular frameworks such as Symfony, Zend framework, and Cake PHP.

Thinking that the form is genuine, your site process it.\nNow suppose that the attacker's form point towards the deletion form in your site. If a user is logged in and redirected to the attacker's site and then perform the search, his account will be deleted without knowing him. That is the CSRF attack.\n\nMore details.",
