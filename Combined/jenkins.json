        "answer": "As an organization starts using more and more pipeline jobs, there is a chance for more and more code being duplicated in every pipeline job, since a part of the build/automation processes will be the same for most of the jobs. In such a situation, every other new upcoming job should also duplicate the same piece of code. To avoid duplications, the Jenkins project brought in the concept of Shared Libraries, to code - DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself. Shared libraries are a set of code that can be common for more than one pipeline job and can be maintained separately. Such libraries improve the maintenance, modularity & readability of the pipeline code. And it also speeds up the automation for new jobs.",

        "question": "9. What happens when a Jenkins agent is offline and what is the best practice in that situation?",
        "answer": "When a job is tied to a specific agent on a specific node, the job can only be run on that agent and no other agents can fulfill the job request. If the target node is offline or all the agents on that particular node are busy building other jobs, then the triggered job has to wait until the node comes online or an agent from that node becomes available to execute the triggered build request. As a result, a triggered job may sometimes wait indefinitely without knowing that the target node is offline. So, it is always the best practice to tie the jobs to a group of nodes & agents, referred to with a 'Label'. Once a job is tied to a Label, instead of a specific node/agent, any of the nodes/agents falling under the label can fulfill a build request, when a job is triggered. This way we can reduce the overall turn-around time of the builds. Even then if a job is waiting for more time for the nodes/agents, then it is time to consider adding more nodes/agents.",

        "question": "2. What is a Ping Thread in Jenkins and how it works?",
        "answer": "Jenkins installs \"ping thread\" on every remote connection, such as Controller/Agent connections, regardless of its transport mechanism (such as SSH, JNLP, etc.). The lower level of the Jenkins Remoting Protocol is a message-oriented protocol, and a ping thread periodically sends a ping message that the receiving end will reply to. The ping thread measures the time it takes for the reply to arrive, and if it’s taking excessive time (currently 4 minutes and configurable), then it assumes that the connection was lost and initiates the formal close down. This is to avoid an infinite hang, as some of the failure modes in the network cannot be detected otherwise. The timeout is also set to a long enough value so that a temporary surge in the load or a long garbage collection pause will not trip off the close-down. Ping thread is installed on both controller & agent; each side pings the other and tries to detect the problem from their sides. The ping thread time out is reported through java.util.logging. Besides, the controller will also report this exception in the agent launch log. Note that some agent launchers, most notably SSH agents, writes all stdout/stderr outputs from the agent JVM into this same log file, so you need to be careful. Conclusion Though these are not the complete possibilities of Jenkins, we tried to cover some of the commonly asked interview questions on core Jenkins. We also need to understand that the Jenkins Update Center is enriched with thousands of useful plugins that enhance the supported functionalities of Jenkins. Before appearing for an interview, make sure to install a Jenkins Server on any of the supported platforms - either locally or on the cloud, install the most common plugins (suggested by Jenkins itself & other commonly used plugins). Try creating & building a normal freestyle project with Git or any other SCM integration plugin and try to execute some code from the connected Git Repository. Also, try creating a pipeline project with JenkinsFile and a global shared Jenkins library and build the job successfully.

        "answer": "Jenkins, and several plugins, allow users to execute Groovy scripts in Jenkins. To protect Jenkins from the execution of malicious scripts, these plugins execute user-provided scripts in a Groovy Sandbox that limits what internal APIs are accessible. This protection is provided by the Script Security plugin. As soon as an unsafe method is used in any of the scripts, the \"In-process Script Approval\" action should appear in \"Manage Jenkins\" to allow Administrators to make a decision about which unsafe methods, if any, should be allowed in the Jenkins environment.

        "answer": "Artifacts are the exportable/storable/archivable results of a specific job build. This can be configured using a plugin called - Copy artifact Plugin. Based on the configured pattern, the files/directories matching the configured patterns will be archived for a Jenkins build, which can be used for future references. In the pipeline, it can be configured as follows - archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'output/**/*'",

        "answer": "Continuous integration is a process where a developer’s code changes are constantly integrated into the main code and the same will be tested automatically and the results of the tests will decide whether the change is ready for deployment. In this process - Developer Makes a change - commit/pull_request - in feature/dev branch\nSource Control Management system generates appropriate events\nSCM Specific Jenkins Plugins like Git/SVN will detect those events from the configured repositories and these events will be used to Trigger - build/dependent/test - jobs on Jenkins\nAfter the Test/Dependent jobs are completed, the change/patch will be labeled according to the status of the test job\nBased on the Status (i.e. readiness of a change to be merged with the main branch), the Continuous Delivery or Continuous Deployment strategy/tool will take it forward.
