        "answer": "Multiple inheritances are a way of passing on multiple copies of a particular class or interface to a child's class. This can be useful when you want to make sure that some code is always available to your child's classes. One way to do this is to create a subclass of the parent class, and then provide the child with a copy of the parent class. Another way is to create multiple inheritances in your Java code, and then provide the child with a reference to the parent class. Multiple inheritances are useful for situations where you need to make sure that some code is always available to your child's classes. In Java, multiple inheritances are implemented using the public and private modifiers on a class or interface. When multiple inheritances are present, the public modifier indicates that the class or interface is publically accessible. The private modifier indicates that the class or interface is privately accessible. Multiple inheritances can be useful when you want to make sure that some code is always available to your child's classes.  ",

This is a good thing because it means that you can use the string class without worrying about its internal state. There are a few things that you can do to subclass the string class, though. First, you can use StringBuilder to create a subclass of the string class. This class can then override the methods that you need to override to create your own subclass of the string class. Second, you can use StringBuffer to create a subclass of the string class. This class can then override the methods that you need to override to create your own subclass of the string class.

This can be used to reduce the number of classes you need to define in your application, and it can also be used to reduce the complexity of your code. When you define a singleton class, you are declaring that the class is only ever going to be created once. This can be useful if you want to reduce the number of instances that your class will have to create, and it can also be useful if you want to reduce the complexity of your code. Singleton classes are often used when you need to create a single instance of a class, but you don't want that instance to be shared across multiple objects. For example, if you want to create a single instance of a class that represents an image, you might create a singleton class that represents that image.",

It is called a mid-level programming language as it combines both a low-level programming language and a high-level programming language. C programming language is mainly used to design applications such as Text Editors, Compilers, Network devices, etc.\nJava Programming Language: Java is a simple, secure, reliable, platform-independent, architecture-neutral, high-level programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995. Java is mainly used to develop banking software, retail software, information technology, android, big data, the research community, web and desktop applications, etc. Now, Java is owned by Oracle.\nPython Programming Language: It is an open-source and easy-to-learn programming language developed in the 1990s. Python is one of the most widely used user-friendly programming languages and is mostly used in Machine learning, Artificial intelligence, Big Data, GUI-based desktop applications, and Robotics.\nC++ Language: It is pronounced as C plus plus. It is one of the thousands of programming languages we use to develop software. Bjarne Stroustrup developed the C++ programming language in 1980. It is similar to the C programming language but also includes additional features such as exception handling, object-oriented programming, type checking, etc.\nC# Programming Language: It is pronounced as C sharp. It is a modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language used with XML-based Web services on the .NET platform. It is mainly designed to improve productivity in web applications. It is easier to learn for those users who have sufficient knowledge of common programming languages like C, C++, or Java.\nJavaScript Language: It is a scripting language used on both the client-side and a server-side. It is developed in the 1990s for the Netscape Navigator web browser. It allows programmers to implement complex features to make web pages alive. It helps programmers create dynamic websites, servers, mobile applications, animated graphics, games, and more.\nPHP Programming Language: PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor. It is an open-source, powerful server-side scripting language mainly used to create static and dynamic websites. Rasmus Laird developed it in 1994.

        "question": "11) What is a constructor in an object-oriented programming language?",
        "answer": "In a class-based object-oriented programming language, a constructor is a special method in the class that is automatically called when the object of that class is created. The constructors have the same name as the class, and they usually initialize the data members of the new object. A constructor is very similar to an instance method, but the difference between the constructor and the method is that the constructor has no explicit return type, it is not implicitly inherited, and it usually has different rules for scope modifiers.\nIf you do not write a constructor in your program, the first thing the object does when it is created is that it looks for a constructor. Java automatically creates a default constructor and calls it if it doesn't find the constructor.\nHere, we are talking about Java (A popular object-oriented programming language). Let's take an example to understand it well. There are two rules to write a constructor:\nClass name and Constructor name should be the same.\nIt should not have any return type.\n\nExample:\nSuppose we have a class named Vehicle.java. It is a java class that only has a constructor in it. Here, we must remember that there is no return type, and the name should match the class name.\nVehicle.java\n// Vehicle.java   \npublic class Vehicle{   \n    public Vehicle(){   \n        System.out.println(\"This is an example of default constructor\");   \n    }   \n}   \nMain.java  \n// Main.java   \npublic class Main{   \n    public static void main(String[] args){   \n        Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle();   \n        //when vehicle object is created, it directly calls Vehicle()   \n        //constructor   \n    }   \n}   \nOutput:\nThis is an example of a default constructor",

        "answer": "Every Object-oriented programming language follows the principle of OOPs. OOPs is an acronym that stands for Object-Oriented Programming System. In Java programming language, the basic OOPs principles are as follows:\nInheritance\nPolymorphism\nAbstraction\nEncapsulation\nBefore learning the core principles of OOPs, we must learn about the basic concepts of Object-Oriented programming language. Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. Here, an object is an entity that has a state and behavior. For example, a chair, table, laptop, bike, pen, pencil, keyboard, etc., are examples of an object. It can be physical or logical. We can define an object as an instance of a class. An object contains an address and takes up some space in memory.\nExample: A cow is an object because it has states like color, name, breed, etc., and behaviors giving milk, eating, etc.\nOn the other hand, a class is the collection of objects. It is a logical entity. We can define a class as a blueprint from which we can create an individual object. Class doesn't consume any space.\nInheritance\nIn Java, Inheritance is the procedure in which one class inherits or acquires all the properties and behaviors of another class. The class whose properties and methods are inherited is called the parent class, and the class which inherits the properties and behaviors is called the child class. Inheritance is used to achieve runtime polymorphism. It also provides code reusability.\nPolymorphism\nPolymorphism is one of the most important concepts of object-oriented programming language. Polymorphism is the ability to perform a task differently or process data in more than one form. The word \"Polymorphism\" is made of two words poly and morphism. Here, poly means many, and morphism means types. In Java, method overloading and method overriding are used to achieve polymorphism.\nAbstraction\nAbstraction is a process of hiding internal details and showing functionalities only. It shows only essential attributes and hides unnecessary information from the users. For example, a phone call; here, the users don't know about the internal processing.\nEncapsulation\nEncapsulation is a process of binding or wrapping up data together into a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. In other words, we can say that encapsulation acts as a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield. A java class is an example of encapsulation.",

Since Java 8, it supports default and static methods also.\nAn Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables. An Interface can have only static and final variables.\nAn abstract class contains a constructor. The Interface does not contain a constructor.\nAn Abstract class can provide the implementation of Interface. The Interface cannot provide the implementation of an abstract class.\nAn abstract class is declared using the \"Abstract\" keyword. The Interface is declared using the \"interface\" keyword.\nAn Abstract class can extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces.

        "question": "19) What are the key differences between C and C++ programming languages?",
        "answer": "A list of key differences between C and C++ programming languages:\nC C++\nC is a Procedural Programming language (Also called Procedure-Oriented language). So, it does not support polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction, and inheritance. C++ is an Object-Oriented Programming language, so it supports polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction, and inheritance.\nDennis Ritchie developed the C language between 1969 and 1973 at AT&T Bells Laboratory. Bjarne Stroustrup developed the C++ programming language in 1979.\nC language is a subset of C++ language. C++ language is a superset of C language.\nC language follows the Top-Down programming approach. C++ follows the bottom-up programming approach.\nIn the C programming language, a big program code is divided into small pieces called functions. In the C++ programming language, a big program code is divided into Objects and Classes.\nIn the C programming language, the file extension is .c. In C++ programming language, the file extension is.cpp.\nC follows procedural programming for the development of code. It is also called mid-level programming language as it follows some features of high-level programming language and some features of low-level programming language. C++ is called hybrid language because it supports procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms.\nThere are 32 keywords in the C programming language. There are 63 keywords in the C++ programming language.\nC language does not support information hiding. In C++, data is hidden by Encapsulation to ensure that data structures and operators are used as intended.\nC supports only built-in data types. C++ supports built-in as well as user-defined data types.\nC is a procedural programming language, so data and functions are separated. C++ is an object-oriented programming language, so data and functions are encapsulated together in the form of an object in C++.\nC is a procedural programming language, and it is also a function-driven language. C++ is an object-oriented programming language, so it is also called an object-driven language.\nC language does not support function and operator overloading. C++ language supports function and operator overloading.\nC language is a function-driven language. C++ language is an object-driven language.\nIn C language, functions cannot be defined inside structures. In C++, functions can be used inside a structure.\nC does not support Namespace features. C++ language uses Namespace, which avoids name collisions.\nHeader file used by C is stdio.h. Header file used by C++ is iostream.h.\nC does not support Reference variables. C++ supports Reference variables.\nC does not support virtual and friend functions. C++ supports virtual and friend functions.\nC language mainly focuses on method or process instead of focusing on data. C++ mainly focuses on data instead of focusing on method or procedure.\nIn C, malloc() and calloc() functions are used for dynamic memory allocation, and free() for memory de-allocation. In C++, a new operator is used for memory allocation and a delete operator for memory de-allocation.\nException handling is not directly supported by C. C++ supports exception handling.\nIn C language, scanf() and printf() functions are used for input/output. In C++, cin and cout are used for input/output.\nC structures don't have access modifiers. C++ structures have access modifiers.\nC structure does not provide the feature of a function declaration. C++ structure provides the feature of declaring a function as a member function of the structure.",

        "answer": "Compiler Interpreter\nA compiler scans the whole program at a time. An Interpreter translates one statement of a program at a time.\nThe compiler scans the whole code at a time, so if it finds any error, it shows at the end together. The interpreter scans program code one line at a time, so the errors are shown line by line.\nIt is fast, and the compiled code runs faster. It works line-by-line, so it is slow, and the interpreted code runs slower.\nCompilers are difficult to implement as they cannot predict what happens at the turn. Interpreters are best suited for the program and development environment.\nCompilers are preferred for their less execution time. Interpreters are slow in executing the object code, so they are less preferred.\nCompilers convert the source code into object code. Interpreters do not convert source code into object code; instead, they scan it line by line.\nCompilers don't require source code for later execution. Interpreters require source code for later execution.\nThe target program executes independently in compilation, so it does not require the compiler in the memory. The interpreters exist in the memory during interpretation.\nExamples of programming languages that use compilers are C, C++, C#, etc. Examples of programming languages that use interpreters are Python, Ruby, Perl, SNOBOL, MATLAB, etc.",

        "answer": "Memory is the most fundamental component of a computer. It is the computer's brain that stores data and information for storing and retrieving. Computer memory can be divided into two types, primary memory, and secondary memory. Primary memory is the computer's main memory that is directly accessed by the central processing unit. On the other hand, secondary memory refers to the external storage device that can be used to store data or information permanently. Both memories are used to serve the same purpose but act differently. Let's see the key differences between them:\nPrimary memory Secondary memory\nPrimary memory is the main memory that can be directly accessed by the Central Processing Unit (CPU). Secondary memory is first transferred to the primary memory and then accessed by the processor because the processor does not directly interact with the secondary memory.\nPrimary memory stores temporary information until the process finishes its execution. Secondary memory is used to store data or information permanently. It is an external storage device.\nThe nature of Primary memory varies accordingly. For RAM, it is volatile. For ROM, it is Non-volatile. Secondary memory is always Non-volatile.\nSemiconductor memory devices are used for primary memory. Magnetic and optical memory devices are used in secondary memory.\nPrimary memory devices are more expensive than secondary storage devices. Secondary memory devices are not as much expensive as primary memory devices.\nPrimary memory is also called Main memory or Internal memory. Secondary memory is also called External memory or Auxiliary memory.\nExamples of Primary memory are RAM, ROM, Cache memory, PROM, EPROM, Registers, etc. Examples of Secondary memory are Hard Disks, Floppy disks, Magnetic Tapes, etc.",
