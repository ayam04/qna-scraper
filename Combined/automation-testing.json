        "answer": "Martin Fowler was the original creator of the test automation pyramid, which was introduced in 2012. It is a strategy for determining how to make the most effective use of the numerous kinds of testing automation available.  The basic tenet of the test pyramid is to have a large number of user interface (UI) unit tests and a small number of complete UI tests.   The testing of user interfaces is a delicate process. The way that user interfaces are designed is undergoing fast change. An update to the software has a high potential of breaking several tests, which will require the team to update them. The testing of the user interface adds additional time to the building process. As long as you have the licence for the GUI testing tool, you can accomplish this task with as few as two or three PCs. For this reason, the test pyramid recommends adding additional automated unit tests in addition to the standard ones that focus on UI automation. Additionally, it offers a service testing layer in the middle, which removes the need to deal with UI frameworks while still providing many of the same benefits as complete end-to-end UI tests. These tests can yield many of the same advantages as full end-to-end UI tests.",

        "question": "4. What is automated regression testing?",
        "answer": "Software is never done. The developers are constantly adding new features, functions, fixing bugs, and so on. There is a chance that all this new code might break the existing functionality that was working. Users dislike using a product that is broken after they download and install a new release. They expect a consistent and reliable experience from the software, no matter which version they are using. They also expect that previously working features will keep on working and won't break in the future. Regression testing is a testing technique where a tester makes sure that the new features didn't break any existing functionality. Its goal is to ensure that previously developed and tested functionality still works after adding new code. When a tester performs the regression testing automatically using testing frameworks and tools, it's known as automated regression testing. In automated regression testing, a tester runs the suite of regression tests after each new release of the software. If the tests pass, then the tester continues with other types of testing. However, if it fails, then there is no point in further proceeding with tests until the developers fix the broken regression tests. Hence, they also act as a time-saver for the tester and ensure quality in software before shipping it.",

        "answer": "With web applications, you can’t guarantee the browsers/platforms/devices your users might use to access your software. Some users could be using Google Chrome on their Android phones, some might use Firefox on a Windows desktop machine, or others could use Safari on their Macbooks. Cross-browser testing ensures that your web application works as expected on different versions of popular browsers on multiple platforms and devices. It ensures that the users get the same experience and features irrespective of which browser they use. It helps to reach a wide range of users, allows the users to switch browsers and devices, and still get the same user experience, increasing customer satisfaction and building a loyal user base.",

Hence, it’s crucial to test the web application or the website on multiple major browsers running on different operating systems. Cross-browser testing is a type of browser automation testing where the tester verifies if the web application will work smoothly on different browsers. Some of the popular browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, etc.   The goal of the cross-browser testing is to launch the application on various browsers running on different operating systems, e.g. Windows, Mac OS, Linux, etc., and verify that the application works as expected. The tester looks for the design/rendering issues, the functionality of the application, and device-specific functionality. Though it can be typically, sophisticated tools exist that allow the testers to automate cross-browser testing. Some examples include Selenium Box, BrowserStack, Browsershots, LambdaTest, etc.",

        "question": "8. What is a test environment?",
        "answer": "A test environment is a computer or a server on which a tester tests the software. After the team builds the software, the tester installs it on this computer with all its dependencies, just like the production environment. This allows the tester to test the software in a real-world scenario.   A test environment enables the tester to create reliable test setups which are identical whenever a new version of the software is released. The test environment includes the test bed, which is the test data using which the tester will test the software. This data helps the tester to verify test cases that need a particular setup. Typically, the test environment is an identical copy of the production environment. Having a duplicate copy allows the tester to reliably reproduce the bugs reported by the customers and provide the exact steps to the developers to fix them. Here are some prerequisites for a good test environment: A server with a similar configuration, including the software and the hardware to match a production environment.\nSample test data with which to test the software.\nTest database with reasonably realistic data, it can be a copy of an actual production database.\nInstalled software under the test.

Some testing can be done only by a human tester, such as user interface testing, usability, and accessibility testing. Exploratory testing is another type of testing where a human tester provides more value than an automated test. In exploratory testing, a tester explores the software randomly, just as an end-user would do, and tries to find the bugs or UI inconsistencies or any hidden problems that developers might have overlooked. Automated testing is helpful for large projects involving complicated calculations and for repeatable test cases. For features that change often and rarely executed test cases, a human tester provides a bigger ROI than automation would.",

        "answer": "Robot Framework is an increasingly popular, open-source automation testing framework primarily used for robotic process automation (RPA). Robotic process automation tries to emulate human actions and interactions with software. Similar to real humans, robotic automation can understand (to an extent) what is on screen, press keys and buttons, navigate to links and extract data. robotic process automation robotic process automation The Robot Framework is written in Python and operating system agnostic. Most of the libraries in the ecosystem are also open-source. It has a modular architecture open for extension with other libraries. It defines the test data in files using a special syntax that’s specific to the framework. A test suite contains multiple such tests. Robot Framework Robot Framework   When you start the execution of the tests, the Robot Framework parses the test data and uses the keywords provided by the libraries to interact with the software. These libraries communicate with the software directly or indirectly using driver tools. The Robot Framework runs the test from the command line. However, you can get detailed reports and logs in both XML and HTML formats. The framework has good support for standard libraries out-of-box, e.g. ArchiveLibrary, Browser Library, DataDriver Library, HttpRequestLibrary (for Java), etc.",

        "question": "10. Who should be responsible for test automation? Developers or the QA?",
        "answer": "As a team is supposed to be a single unit responsible for shipping a quality software system, it’s a team’s responsibility to write, execute, and manage test scripts. That means the developers and the QA should collaborate and use each other’s skills to perform automation testing effectively. Each team has a different skill set. Some have more technical testers, some have quality-focused developers, and some have testers who came from development backgrounds and vice versa. Hence it’s not a good idea to pigeonhole automated testing to a particular department. Instead, collaboration and working together is the key to a successful automated testing strategy.",

It is a type of security measure and is also known as challenge-response authentication. The primary goal of the CAPTCHA is to protect you from spam or denial-of-service attacks by bots/scripts by asking you to complete a simple test that is difficult for computers to follow. It proves you are human and not a computer.   A CAPTCHA challenge consists of two parts: A randomly generated sequence of letters/numbers. These alphanumeric characters appear as distorted images and might appear behind other non-significant characters to make it difficult for a computer to parse them. \nA text box where the user is supposed to copy the characters.

If it could, then it’s not a good challenge that you can use in your application. However, if you need to test an application that uses CAPTCHA, you have to work with the development team to build a workaround or a back door that allows the automated test to bypass the CAPTCHA challenge.

Validating the tests will fail\nSimilar to testing that software will work, it's essential to ensure the test will fail if the feature its testing doesn't meet the criteria. \nA test that never fails is worse than having no tests, as it gives a false assurance that the feature is working. \nDon't Repeat Yourself (DRY)\nAvoiding duplication in code is crucial.  \nThe benefit of this strategy is that the change is isolated to a single location, preventing bugs and errors. \nKeep Functions Small\nSince the testers who are creating automated tests are not familiar with good coding standards, it's easy to fall into the trap of creating giant functions that try to do everything. \nThis quickly results in unmaintainable code that the team is afraid to touch when the requirements change, resulting in out-of-date tests that test the legacy behavior of the system. \nWrite Good Documentation\nHaving well-written documentation explains not only the what, but then why is important for new team members when they try to understand the tests. \nIt can also help the person who wrote the tests when they try to modify/understand the tests in the future.

Though automated tests help avoid regression issues or find problems that you are already aware of, manual exploratory testing is essential to find the bugs you don’t know about, such as incorrect requirements or implementations. Some types of testing, such as exploratory testing, usability, and accessibility testing, need to be performed by a human tester. \nAutomated testing is only as good as automated tests. If bugs or problems are in the tests themselves, they will provide wrong results, giving false assurance to the stakeholders.  Good automation testing tests repeatable test cases which you can reproduce deterministically. It certainly reduces the amount of manual testing that a human tester would perform but does not eliminate it.
