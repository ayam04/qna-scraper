        "answer": "Uses of variants in AutoCAD:\nADVERTISEMENT\nAutoCAD uses a lot of variants and releases that provide capabilities to build an application.\nAutoCAD provides 3D capability that gives fewer rises to the releases of the applications.\nVariants are also used to increase the variations present in the application or the package used in a particular program.\nThe AutoCAD's variants also help create, visualize, and render the 3D models that provide the 3D printing.\nVariants facilitate us to use different functionalities of the function in the application and execute it according to the needs.",
