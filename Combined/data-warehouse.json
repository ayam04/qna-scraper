        "answer": "Cluster analysis is used to define the object without giving the class label. It analyzes all the data that is present in the Data Warehouse and compares the cluster with the cluster that is already running. It performs the task of assigning some set of objects into groups, also known as clusters. It is used to perform the data mining job using a technique like statistical data analysis. It includes all the information and knowledge around many fields such as Machine Learning, pattern recognition, image analysis, and bio-informatics. Cluster analysis performs the iterative process of knowledge discovery and includes trials and failures. It is used with the pre-processing and other parameters to achieve the properties that are desired to be used.\nPurpose of cluster analysis:\nScalability\nAbility to deal with different kinds of attributes\nDiscovery of clusters with attribute shape\nHigh dimensionality\nAbility to deal with noise\nInterpretability\nLearn more about Data Warehousing in this insightful Data Warehouse Tutorial!",

        "answer": "Agglomerative hierarchical clustering method allows clusters to be read from bottom to top so that the program always reads from the sub-component first then moves to the parent; whereas, divisive hierarchical clustering uses top to bottom approach in which the parent is visited first then the child.\nAgglomerative hierarchical method consists of objects in which each object creates its own clusters, and these clusters are grouped together to create a large cluster. It is a process of continuous merging until all the single clusters are merged together into a complete big cluster that will consist of all the objects of child clusters. However, in divisive clustering, the parent cluster is divided into smaller clusters, and it keeps on dividing until each cluster has a single object to represent.\nLearn business analytics from this professional Business Analyst Certification in Bangalore and get started with your career journey.",

        "answer": "Chameleon is a hierarchical clustering algorithm that overcomes the limitations of the existing models and methods present in Data Warehousing. This method operates on the sparse graph having nodes that represent data items and edges which represent the weights of the data items.\nThis representation allows large datasets to be created and operated successfully. The method finds the clusters that are used in the dataset using the two-phase algorithm.\nThe first phase consists of the graph partitioning that allows the clustering of the data items into a large number of sub-clusters.\nThe second phase uses an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm to search for the clusters that are genuine and can be combined together with the sub-clusters that are produced.\nInterested in learning more about Data Warehousing?

        "question": "9. What is ODS?",
        "answer": "An operational data store (ODS) is a database designed to integrate data from multiple sources for additional operations on the data. Unlike a master data store, the data is not sent back to operational systems. It may be passed for further operations and to the Data Warehouse for reporting.\nIn ODS, data can be scrubbed, resolved for redundancy, and checked for compliance with the corresponding business rules. This data store can be used for integrating disparate data from multiple sources so that business operations, analysis, and reporting can be carried out. This is the place where most of the data used in the current operation is housed before it’s transferred to the Data Warehouse for longer-term storage or archiving.\nAn ODS is designed for relatively simple queries on small amounts of data (such as finding the status of a customer order), rather than the complex queries on large amounts of data typical of the Data Warehouse.\nAn ODS is similar to the short-term memory where it only stores very recent information. On the contrary, the Data Warehouse is more like long-term memory, storing relatively permanent information.\nWant to learn more about SQL?

Structural Metadata describes how an object should be classified in order to fit into a wider system of things. Structural Metadata makes a link with other files that allows them to be categorized and used in a variety of ways. Administrative Metadata contains information about an object's history, who owned it previously, and what it can be used for. Rights, licences, and permissions are examples. This information is useful for persons who are in charge of managing and caring for an asset. When a piece of information is placed in the correct context, it takes on a whole new meaning.

The precomputed data is stored in a data cube, which makes online analytical processing easier. We all think of a cube as a three-dimensional structure, however in data warehousing, an n-dimensional data cube can be implemented. A data cube stores information in terms of dimensions and facts.   Data Cubes have two categories. They are as follows : Multidimensional Data Cube : Data is stored in multidimensional arrays, which allows for a multidimensional view of the data. A multidimensional data cube aids in the storage of vast amounts of information. A multidimensional data cube uses indexing to represent each dimension of the data cube, making it easier to access, retrieve, and store data.\nRelational Data Cube : The relational data cube can be thought of as an \"expanded version of relational DBMS.\" Data is stored in relational tables, and each relational table represents a data cube's dimension. The relational data cube uses SQL to produce aggregated data, although it is slower than the multidimensional data cube in terms of performance.

        "question": "8. What are the characteristics of a data warehouse?",
        "answer": "Following are the characteristics of a data warehouse:-   Subject-oriented : Because it distributes information about a theme rather than an organization's actual operations, a data warehouse is always subject-oriented. It is possible to do so with a certain theme. That is to say, the data warehousing procedure is intended to deal with a more defined theme. These themes could include sales, distribution, and marketing, for example. The focus of a data warehouse is never solely on present activities. Instead, it concentrates on demonstrating and analyzing evidence in order to reach diverse conclusions. It also provides a simple and precise demonstration around a specific theme by removing info that isn't needed to make conclusions.\nIntegrated : It is similar to subject orientation in that it is created in a dependable format. Integration entails the creation of a single entity to scale all related data from several databases. The data has to be stored in several data warehouses in a shared and widely accessible manner. A data warehouse is created by combining information from a variety of sources, such as a mainframe and a relational database. It must also have dependable naming conventions, formats, and codes. The utilization of a data warehouse allows for more effective data analysis. The consistency of name conventions, column scaling, and encoding structure, among other things, should be validated. The data warehouse integration handles a variety of subject-related warehouses.\nTime-Variant : Data is kept in this system at various time intervals, such as weekly, monthly, or annually. It discovers a number of time limits that are structured between massive datasets and held in the online transaction process (OLTP). Data warehouse time limitations are more flexible than those of operational systems. The data in the data warehouse is predictable over a set period of time and provides information from a historical standpoint. It contains explicit or implicit time elements. Another property of time-variance is that data cannot be edited, altered, or updated once it has been placed in the data warehouse.\nNon-volatile : The data in a data warehouse is permanent, as the name implies. It also means that when new data is put, it is not erased or removed. It incorporates a massive amount of data that is placed into logical business alteration between the designated quantity. It assesses the analysis in the context of warehousing technologies. Data is read-only and refreshed at scheduled intervals. This is useful for analyzing historical data and understanding how things work. It is not required to have a transaction process, a recapture mechanism, or a concurrency control mechanism. In a data warehouse environment, operations like delete, update, and insert that are performed in an operational application are lost. Subject-oriented : Because it distributes information about a theme rather than an organization's actual operations, a data warehouse is always subject-oriented. It is possible to do so with a certain theme. That is to say, the data warehousing procedure is intended to deal with a more defined theme. These themes could include sales, distribution, and marketing, for example. The focus of a data warehouse is never solely on present activities. Instead, it concentrates on demonstrating and analyzing evidence in order to reach diverse conclusions. It also provides a simple and precise demonstration around a specific theme by removing info that isn't needed to make conclusions. Subject-oriented : Integrated : It is similar to subject orientation in that it is created in a dependable format. Integration entails the creation of a single entity to scale all related data from several databases. The data has to be stored in several data warehouses in a shared and widely accessible manner. A data warehouse is created by combining information from a variety of sources, such as a mainframe and a relational database. It must also have dependable naming conventions, formats, and codes. The utilization of a data warehouse allows for more effective data analysis. The consistency of name conventions, column scaling, and encoding structure, among other things, should be validated. The data warehouse integration handles a variety of subject-related warehouses. Integrated : Time-Variant : Data is kept in this system at various time intervals, such as weekly, monthly, or annually. It discovers a number of time limits that are structured between massive datasets and held in the online transaction process (OLTP). Data warehouse time limitations are more flexible than those of operational systems.

        "answer": "The technical capacity to collect transactions as they change and integrate them into the warehouse, as well as maintaining batch or planned cycle refreshes, is known as active data warehousing. Automating routine processes and choices is possible with an active data warehouse. The active data warehouse sends decisions to the On-Line Transaction Processing (OLTP) systems automatically. An active data warehouse is designed to capture and distribute data in real time. They give you a unified view of your customers across all of your business lines. Business Intelligence Systems are linked to it.",

If you perform a query on the real-time data warehouse to learn more about a specific aspect of the company or entity described by the warehouse, the result reflects the status of that entity at the time the query was run. Most data warehouses contain data that is highly latent — that is, data that reflects the business at a specific point in time.

        "answer": "A fact table with no measures is known as a factless fact table. It's essentially a crossroads of dimensions (it contains nothing but dimensional keys). One form of factless table is used to capture an event, while the other is used to describe conditions. In the first type of factless fact table, there is no measured value for an event, but it develops the relationship among the dimension members from several dimensions. The existence of the relationship is itself the fact. This type of fact table can be utilised to create valuable reports on its own. Various criteria can be used to count the number of occurrences. The second type of factless fact table is a tool that's used to back up negative analytical reports. Consider a store that did not sell a product for a period of time. To create such a report, you'll need a factless fact table that captures all of the conceivable product combinations that were on offer. By comparing the factless table to the sales table for the list of things that did sell, you can figure out what's missing.",

        "answer": "Following are the different types of data mart in data warehousing:   Dependent Data Mart: A dependent data mart can be developed using data from operational, external, or both sources. It enables the data of the source company to be accessed from a single data warehouse. All data is centralized, which can aid in the development of further data marts.\nIndependent Data Mart: There is no need for a central data warehouse with this data mart. This is typically established for smaller groups that exist within a company. It has no connection to Enterprise Data Warehouse or any other data warehouse. Each piece of information is self-contained and can be used independently. The analysis can also be carried out independently. It's critical to maintain a consistent and centralized data repository that numerous users can access.\nHybrid Data Mart: A hybrid data mart is utilized when a data warehouse contains inputs from multiple sources, as the name implies. When a user requires an ad hoc integration, this feature comes in handy. This solution can be utilized if an organization requires various database environments and quick implementation. It necessitates the least amount of data purification, and the data mart may accommodate huge storage structures. When smaller data-centric applications are employed, a data mart is most effective.

        "answer": "Following are the different types of data warehouse:   Enterprise Data Warehouse:\nAn enterprise database is a database that brings together the various functional areas of an organisation in a cohesive manner. It's a centralised location where all corporate data from various sources and apps can be accessed. They can be utilised for analytics and by everyone in the organisation once they've been saved. The data can be categorised by subject, and access is granted according to the necessary division. The tasks of extracting, converting, and conforming are taken care of in an Enterprise Datawarehouse.\nEnterprise Datawarehouse's purpose is to provide a comprehensive overview of any object in the data model. This is performed by finding and wrangling the data from different systems. This is then loaded into a model that is consistent and conformed. The data is acquired by Enterprise Datawarehouse, which can provide access to a single site where various tools can be used to execute analytical functions and generate various predictions. New trends or patterns can be identified by research teams, which can then be focused on to help the company expand.\nOperational Data Store (ODS):\nAn operational data store is utilised instead of having an operational decision support system application. It facilitates data access directly from the database, as well as transaction processing. By checking the associated business rules, the data in the Operational Data Store may be cleansed, and any redundancy found can be checked and rectified. It also aids in the integration of disparate data from many sources so that business activities, analysis, and reporting may be carried out quickly and effectively while the process is still ongoing. \nThe majority of current operations are stored here before being migrated to the data warehouse for a longer period of time. It is particularly useful for simple searches and little amounts of data. It functions as short-term or temporary memory, storing recent data.

This ensures that data is of higher quality and homogeneous. As a result, you and your team can rest assured that your data is accurate, resulting in more informed corporate decisions. Enhances Data Security:\nA data warehouse improves security by incorporating cutting-edge security features into its design. For any business, consumer data is a vital resource. You can keep all of your data sources integrated and properly protected by adopting a warehousing solution. The risk of a data breach will be greatly reduced as a result of this.

        "answer": "The record of a reality or fact table could be made up of attributes from various dimension tables. The Fact Table, also known as the Reality Table, assists the user in investigating the business aspects that aid him in call taking in order to improve his firm. Dimension Tables, on the other hand, make it easier for the reality table or fact table to collect dimensions from which measurements must be taken. The following table enlists the difference between a fact table and a dimension table:-   Fact Table  Dimension Table \nIt contains the attributes' measurements, facts, or metrics. It is the companion table that has the attributes that the fact table uses to derive the facts.\nData grain (the most atomic level by which facts may be defined) is what defines it.

        "question": "18. What are the different types of dimension tables in the context of data warehousing?",
        "answer": "Following are the different types of dimension tables in the context of data warehousing:-    Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD): Slowly changing dimensions are dimension attributes that tend to vary slowly over time rather than at a regular period of time. For example, the address and phone number may change, but not on a regular basis. Consider the case of a man who travels to several nations and must change his address according to the place he is visiting. This can be accomplished in one of three ways:\nType 1: Replaces the value that was previously entered. This strategy is simple to implement and aids in the reduction of costs by saving space. However, in this circumstance, history is lost.\nType 2: Insert a new row containing the new value. This method saves the history and allows it to be accessed at any time. However, it takes up a lot of space, which raises the price.\nType 3: Add a new column to the table. It is the ideal strategy because history can be easily preserved.\nJunk Dimension: A trash dimension is a collection of low-cardinality attributes. It contains a number of varied or disparate features that are unrelated to one another. These can be used to implement RCD (rapidly changing dimension) features like flags and weights, among other things.\nConformed Dimension: Multiple subject areas or data marts share this dimension. It can be utilised in a variety of projects without requiring any changes. This is used to keep things in order. Dimensions that are exactly the same as or a proper subset of any other dimension are known as conformed dimensions.\nRoleplay Dimension: Role-play dimension refers to the dimension table that has many relationships with the fact table. In other words, it occurs when the same dimension key and all of its associated attributes are linked to a large number of foreign keys in the fact table. Within the same database, it might serve several roles.\nDegenerate Dimension: Degenerate dimension attributes are those that are contained in the fact table itself rather than in a separate dimension table.

        "answer": "A table in a data warehouse's star schema is referred to as a dimension table. Dimensional data models, which are made up of fact and dimension tables, are used to create data warehouses. Dimension tables contain dimension keys, values, and attributes and are used to describe dimensions. It is usually of a tiny size. The number of rows might range from a few to thousands. It is a description of the objects in the fact table. The term \"dimension table\" refers to a collection or group of data pertaining to any quantifiable occurrence. They serve as the foundation for dimensional modelling. It includes a column that serves as a primary key, allowing each dimension row or record to be uniquely identified. Through this key, it is linked to the fact tables. When it's constructed, a system-generated key called the surrogate key is used to uniquely identify the rows in the dimension.

        "question": "20. What do you understand about a fact table in the context of a data warehouse? What are the different types of fact tables?",
        "answer": "In a Data Warehouse system, a Fact table is simply a table that holds all of the facts or business information that can be exposed to reporting and analysis when needed. Fields that reflect direct facts, as well as foreign fields that connect the fact table to other dimension tables in the Data Warehouse system, are stored in these tables. Depending on the model type used to construct the Data Warehouse, a Data Warehouse system can have one or more fact tables. Following are the three types of fact tables:-   Transactional Fact Table: This is a very basic and fundamental view of corporate processes. It can be used to depict the occurrence of an event at any given time. The facts measure are only valid at that specific time and for that specific incident. \"One row per line in a transaction,\" according to the grain associated with the transaction table. It typically comprises data at the detailed level, resulting in a huge number of dimensions linked with it. It captures the smallest or atomic level of dimension measurement. This allows the table to provide users with extensive dimensional grouping, roll-up, and drill-down reporting features. It's packed yet sparse at the same time. It can also be big at the same time, depending on the number of events (transactions) that have occurred.\nSnapshot Fact Table: The snapshot depicts the condition of things at a specific point in time, sometimes known as a \"picture of the moment.\" It usually contains a greater number of non-additive and semi-additive information. It aids in the examination of the company's overall performance at regular and predictable times. Unlike the transaction fact table, which adds a new row for each occurrence of an event, this represents the performance of an activity at the end of each day, week, month, or any other time interval. However, to retrieve the detailed data in the transaction fact table, snapshot fact tables or periodic snapshots rely on the transaction fact table. The periodic snapshot tables are typically large and take up a lot of space.\nAccumulating Fact Table: These are used to depict the activity of any process with a well-defined beginning and end. Multiple data stamps are commonly found in accumulating snapshots, which reflect the predictable stages or events that occur over the course of a lifespan. There is sometimes an extra column with the date that indicates when the row was last updated. Transactional Fact Table: This is a very basic and fundamental view of corporate processes.

        "question": "21. What do you mean by OLAP in the context of data warehousing? What guidelines should be followed while selecting an OLAP system?",
        "answer": "OLAP is an acronym for On-Line Analytical Processing. OLAP is a software technology classification that allows analysts, managers, and executives to get insight into information through quick, reliable, interactive access to data that has been converted from raw data to reflect the true dimensionality of the company as perceived by the clients. OLAP allows for multidimensional examination of corporate data while also allowing for complex estimations, trend analysis, and advanced data modelling. It's rapidly improving the foundation for Intelligent Solutions, which includes Business Performance Management, Strategy, Budgeting, Predicting, Financial Documentation, Analysis, Modeling, Knowledge Discovery, and Data Warehouses Reporting. End-clients can use OLAP to perform ad hoc record analysis in several dimensions, giving them the information and understanding they need to make better choices. On-Line Analytical Processing Following guidelines must be followed while selecting an OLAP system:-   Multidimensional Conceptual View: This is one of an OLAP system's most important capabilities. It is feasible to use methods like slice and dice that require a multidimensional view.\nTransparency: Make the technology, the underlying data repository, computing operations, and the disparate nature of source data completely accessible to consumers. Users' efficiency and productivity are improved as a result of this transparency.\nAccessibility: OLAP systems must only allow access to the data that is truly needed to do the analysis, giving clients a single, coherent, and consistent picture. The OLAP system must map its own logical schema to the disparate physical data storage, as well as to conduct any required transformations. \nConsistent Reporting Performance: As the number of dimensions or the size of the database grows, users should not experience any substantial reduction in documenting performance. That is, as the number of dimensions grows, OLAP performance should not deteriorate.\nClient/Server Architecture: Make the OLAP tool's server component clever enough that the various clients can be connected with minimal effort and integration code. The server should be able to map and consolidate data from disparate databases.\nGeneric Dimensionality: Each dimension in an OLAP method should be seen as equal in terms of structure and operational capabilities. Select dimensions may be granted additional operational capabilities, although such duties should be available to all dimensions.\nDynamic Sparse Matrix Handling: To optimise sparse matrix handling by adapting the physical schema to the unique analytical model being built and loaded. When confronted with a sparse matrix, the system must be able to dynamically assume the information distribution and change storage and access in order to achieve and maintain a constant level of performance.\nMultiuser Support: OLAP technologies must allow several users to access data at the same time while maintaining data integrity and security.\nUnrestricted cross-dimensional Operations: It gives techniques the ability to determine dimensional order and to perform roll-up and drill-down operations within and across dimensions.\nIntuitive Data Manipulation: Reorientation (pivoting), drill-down and roll-up, and other manipulations can be done intuitively and precisely on the cells of the scientific model using point-and-click and drag-and-drop methods. It does away with the need for a menu or several visits to the user interface.\nFlexible Reporting: It provides efficiency to corporate clients by allowing them to organize columns, rows, and cells in a way that allows for easy data manipulation, analysis, and synthesis.\nInfinite Dimensions and Aggregation Levels: There should be no limit to the number of data dimensions.

        "question": "2. Differentiate between Agglomerative hierarchical clustering and Divisive clustering.",
        "answer": "Agglomerative hierarchical clustering : Flat clustering returns an unstructured set of clusters. On the other hand, this structure is more informative. We don't have to define the number of clusters in advance with this clustering procedure. Bottom-up algorithms start by treating each piece of data as a singleton cluster, then agglomerate pairs of clusters until all of them are merged into a single cluster that contains all of the data. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering : Divisive Clustering : This approach also eliminates the need to define the number of clusters ahead of time. It necessitates a method for breaking a cluster that contains all of the data and then recursively splitting clusters until all of the data has been split into singletons. Divisive Clustering : Following are the differences between the two : When compared to agglomerative clustering, divisive clustering is more complicated since we require a flat clustering algorithm as a \"subroutine\" to split each cluster until each data has its own singleton cluster.\nIf we don't create a complete hierarchy all the way down to individual data leaves, divisive clustering is more efficient.\nA divisive algorithm is also more precise. Without first examining the global distribution of data, agglomerative clustering makes judgments based on local patterns or neighbour points. These early decisions are irreversible.

        "question": "4. What do you understand by data lake in the context of data warehousing? Differentiate between data lake and data warehouse.",
        "answer": "A Data Lake is a large-scale storage repository for structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. It's a location where you can save any type of data in its original format, with no restrictions on account size or file size. It provides a significant amount of data for improved analytical performance and native integration. A data lake is a huge container that looks a lot like a lake or a river. Similar to how a lake has various tributaries, a data lake has structured data, unstructured data, machine-to-machine communication, and logs flowing through in real-time. The following table enlists the differences between data lake and data warehouse:   Data Lake  Data Warehouse \nAll data is stored in the data lake, regardless of its source or structure. The data is stored in its unprocessed state. When it is ready to be used, it is converted. Data extracted from transactional systems or data consisting of quantitative measures and their properties will be stored in a data warehouse. The information has been cleansed and changed.\nCaptures semi-structured and unstructured data in their original form from source systems. Captures structured data and organises it according to defined standards for data warehouse purposes.\nThe data lake is appropriate for those that perform in-depth analysis. Data scientists, for example, require advanced analytical techniques that include predictive modelling and statistical analysis. Because it is highly structured, easy to use, and understand, the data warehouse is perfect for operational users.\nThe cost of storing data in big data technology is less than that of storing data in a data warehouse. Data warehouse storage is more expensive and time-consuming.\nThe schema is usually developed after the data has been stored. This provides a great level of flexibility and convenience of data collecting, but it necessitates labour at the end of the process. Schema is usually defined before data is saved. Work is required at the start of the process, but performance, security, and integration are all advantages.\nUsers can access data in data lakes before it has been transformed, cleansed, or structured. In comparison to a traditional data warehouse, it allows consumers to get to their results faster. Pre-defined inquiries for pre-defined data kinds are answered by data warehouses. As a result, any updates to the data warehouse take longer. Data Lake  Data Warehouse \nAll data is stored in the data lake, regardless of its source or structure.

        "question": "5. What do you mean by dimensional modelling in the context of data warehousing?",
        "answer": "Dimensional Modelling (DM) is a data structure technique that is specifically designed for data storage in a data warehouse. The goal of dimensional modelling is to optimise the database so that data can be retrieved more quickly. In a data warehouse, a dimensional model is used to read, summarise, and analyse numeric data such as values, balances, counts, weights, and so on. Relation models, on the other hand, are designed for adding, modifying, and deleting data in a real-time Online Transaction System. Following are the steps that should be followed while creating a dimensional model:   Identifying the business process : The first step is to identify the specific business processes that a data warehouse should address. This might be Marketing, Sales, or Human Resources, depending on the organization's data analytic needs. The quality of data available for that process is also a factor in deciding which business process to use. It is the most crucial step in the Data Modeling process, and a failure here would result in a cascade of irreversible flaws.\nIdentifying the grain : The level of detail for the business problem/solution is described by the grain. It's the procedure for determining the lowest level of data in any table in your data warehouse. If a table contains sales data for each day, the granularity should be daily. Monthly granularity is defined as a table that contains total sales data for each month.\nIdentifying the dimension : Date, shop, inventory, and other nouns are examples of dimensions. All of the data should be saved in these dimensions. The date dimension, for example, could include information such as the year, month, and weekday.\nIdentifying the fact : This stage is linked to the system's business users because it is here that they gain access to data housed in the data warehouse. The majority of the rows in the fact table are numerical values such as price or cost per unit.\nBuilding the schema : The Dimension Model is implemented in this step.

        "question": "6. What do you mean by data purging in the context of data warehousing?",
        "answer": "Data purging is a term that describes techniques for permanently erasing and removing data from a storage space. Data purging, which is typically contrasted with data deletion, involves a variety of procedures and techniques.   Purging removes data permanently and frees up memory or storage space for other purposes, whereas deletion is commonly thought of as a temporary preference. Automatic data purging features are one of the methods for data cleansing in database administration. Some Microsoft products, for example, feature an automatic purge strategy that uses a circular buffer mechanism, in which older data is purged to create room for fresh data. Administrators must manually remove data from the database in other circumstances.",

They are as follows: Top-Down Approach in Data Warehouse: Top-Down Approach in Data Warehouse:   Following are the major components : External Sources - An external source is a location from which data is collected, regardless of the data format. Structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data are all possibilities.\nStage Area - Because the data gathered from external sources does not follow a specific format, it must be validated before being loaded into the data warehouse. ETL tool is used for this purpose in the stage area.\nData-warehouse - After data has been cleansed, it is kept as a central repository in the data warehouse. The meta data is saved here, while the real data is housed in data marts. In this top-down approach, the data warehouse stores the data in its purest form.\nData Marts - A data mart is a storage component as well. It maintains information about a single organization's function that is managed by a single authority. Depending on the functions, an organization can have as many data marts as it wants. \nData Mining - Data mining is the process of analyzing large amounts of data in a data warehouse.

This adopts star, snowflake, or fact constellation mode of subject-oriented database design.\nBack-up and system administration Regular database back-up and system administration can do the job. Reloading the OLTP data is well treated as a good backup option.\nClick here for more information",

        "answer": "ETL stands for extraction, transformation, and loading process. ETL is software that allows the business to develop their disparate records while moving it from place to place, and it doesn't really matter that data is in several forms or formats. The data can come from any source. ETL is powerful enough to manage such data disparities.\nFirst, the extract function reads data from a particular source database and extracts a desired subset of data.\nSecond, the transform function works with the acquired record using rules or lookup tables, or creating a combination with other records to convert it to the desired state.\nFinally, the load function is used to write the resulting information to a target database.\nClick here for more information",

        "answer": "Multidimensional OLAP (MOLAP) is faster than Relational OLAP (ROLAP).\nMOLAP: Here, data is saved in a multidimensional cube. The storage is not in the relational database but in a proprietary plan (one example is PowerOLAP's .olp file). MOLAP products are compatible with Excel, which can make record interactions easy to learn.\nROLAP: ROLAP products approach a relational database by using SQL (structured query language), which is the standard language that is used to describe and manipulate data in an RDBMS. Subsequent processing may occur in the RDBMS or within a middle-tier server, which accepts requests from users, translates them into SQL statements, and passes them on to the RDBMS.",
