Conclusion To put it simply, behavioral interview questions are based on how you would likely behave if you were faced with a certain situation in the future. A behavioral interview, along with a coding test and a technical interview, will be used by the hiring manager to determine if your past performance can assist you in putting your best foot forward in your new role, as well as determining if you have what it takes to succeed there. A concise way of answering behavioral questions is through the STAR method. In short, the STAR method stands for Situation, Task, Action, Result, and it helps you create a story that's easy to follow and has a clear conflict and resolution. In sharing your stories, make sure you specify a situation, task, action, and result, and emphasize skills and abilities most relevant to the job. You may be asked to share non-work-related examples, so think about challenges you have overcome personally.",
