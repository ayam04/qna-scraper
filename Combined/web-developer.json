        "question": "2. List the advantages of HTTP/2 over HTTP 1.1.",
        "answer": "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a set of standard protocols allowing internet users to exchange website knowledge on WWW (World Wide Web). HTTP has gone through four iterations since it was introduced in 1991 i.e., HTTP/0.9, HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1, and HTTP/2.0. In 2015, HTTP/2 was released as a major revision to HTTP/1.1. HTTP/2.0 has the following advantages over HTTP/1.1:   Increased performance: It was designed specifically to speed up page loading and reduce round-trip time (RTT) for resource-intensive websites.\nHandle multiple resources: With HTTP 1.1, the web pages were manageable simply by using HTML markups and images. But with HTTP 2.0, there are now multiple resources available for web pages, including images, fonts, scripts, and more. HTTP 1.1 was not designed to handle such a large amount of resources today.\nMultiplexing: Multiplexing is fully implemented in HTTP/2. It means that multiple requests are sent between browsers and servers simultaneously over a single TCP connection. Consequently, several elements of a web page can be delivered via a single TCP connection. As a result, the HTTP/1.1 head-of-line blocking problem is resolved, in which a packet at the front of the line blocks the transmission of other packets.\nHeader Compression: HTTP 2.0 has the ability to compress HTTP headers to reduce overhead. When HTML headers on web pages are compressed, they can be sent between the browser and server in one trip, over a single TCP connection.\nServer push: HTTP/2 servers are able to push resources into a browser's cache even before they are requested. By doing this, browsers can display content without requiring additional requests.\nBinary protocols: HTTP/2 use binary protocols, not textual. HTML/2's binary protocols consume less bandwidth, can be parsed more efficiently, and are less error-prone compared to HTTP/1.1's textual protocols.

        "question": "3. Explain CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) and Write its Importance.",
        "answer": "CORS stands for Cross-origin resource sharing. It is basically defined as a browser mechanism that enables web pages from one domain to have controlled access to resources that are located at different domains (cross-domain request). In other words, it allows scripts running on a browser client to interact with and access resources from other origins. It provides and extends flexibility to the SOP (Same-Origin Policy). A same-origin policy restricts a website's ability to access resources outside its source domain. For example, if a JavaScript app wanted to call an API (Application Programming Interface) running on another domain, it would be blocked and prevented from doing so because of the SOP. Due to restrictions caused by the same-origin policy, CORS was introduced.   When a website's CORS policy is set up poorly, it also poses the risk of cross-domain attacks. As such, it cannot prevent cross-origin attacks such as  CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery).",

        "question": "4. What do you mean by ETag (Entity Tag) and how does it work?",
        "answer": "The ETag (entity tag) is a part of the HTTP protocol. This is one of several mechanisms that HTTP provides to validate Web caches, which allows conditional requests to be made from a browser to resources. Moreover, Etags make sure that simultaneous updates of the same resource don't overwrite each other (mid-air collisions). ETags are opaque identifiers assigned by a server to a specific version of a resource found at a specific URL. Every time the resource representation at that URL changes, an entirely new ETag is assigned. As such, ETags can be compared in the same way as fingerprints and determine if two representations of a resource are identical. Syntax: Syntax: ETag: W/\"<etag_value>\" ETag: W/\"<etag_value>\" ETag: \"<etag_value>\" ETag: \"<etag_value>\"",

Modules are reusable chunks of code that are built from the JavaScript, node_modules, images, and CSS styles of your application, and packaged so that they can be easily added to your website. If you have a large number of files, Webpack generates a single (or a few) file that runs your application.   When Webpack processes your application or package, it generates a dependency graph, which consists of various modules that your webapp needs in order to function as expected. Based on this graph, it then creates a new package that contains only the bare minimum files required, often only one or a few bundle.js files which can be easily plugged into the HTML file and used in the application.",

        "question": "4. What are pseudo-classes?",
        "answer": "A pseudo-class is basically used to define or specify a special state of an HTML element. This can be used in conjunction with an existing CSS selector to add effects to elements based on their state. For instance, changing the style of an element when a user hovers over it or using different styles for visited and unvisited links. The pseudo-class gives you the ability to do all of this. Syntax: selector: pseudo-class{\n    property: value;\n} selector: pseudo-class{\n    property: value;\n} In CSS, there are many pseudo-classes, but the ones that are most frequently used are as follows: :visited pseudo-class: Select the links that the user has already visited.\n:hover pseudo-class: A special effect can be added to an element when the mouse pointer is over it.\n:active pseudo-class: Select the element that becomes active when the user clicks on it.\n:focus pseudo-class: Select an element that is currently focused by the user. :visited pseudo-class: Select the links that the user has already visited. :visited pseudo-class :hover pseudo-class: A special effect can be added to an element when the mouse pointer is over it. :hover pseudo-class :active pseudo-class: Select the element that becomes active when the user clicks on it. :active pseudo-class :focus pseudo-class: Select an element that is currently focused by the user. :focus pseudo-class",

        "answer": "Long polling is generally a web application development method that is used to push information or data from the server to the client as quickly as possible. Long-polling maintains the connection between client and server after a request has been made from the client to the server. The connection is maintained until information becomes available from the server and it is ready to send it to the client.  If the server receives a request from the client, it doesn't close the connection immediately; the connection is only closed when the server sends the data back to the client or when a timeout threshold is reached (connection timeout).

        "answer": "In simple terms, Canvas (<canvas> tag) is an HTML element that enables you to draw or create graphics on a web page using JavaScript. This is a new tag in HTML5. Canvas allows you to dynamically control graphics, images, and text on your web pages, adding a great deal of interactivity. You can create graphs, combine photos, and create animated elements using the CANVAS element. Syntax: <canvas id = \"script\"> Contents... </canvas> <canvas id = \"script\"> Contents... </canvas> Example: In this example, we have a simple *canvas> element that only has two specific attributes: width (set width of the canvas) and height (set height of the canvas), along with the HTML5 core attributes such as id, name, and class. <!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n   <body>\n         \n       <!-- canvas Tag starts here -->\n       <canvas id = \"InterviewBit\" width = \"100\" \n           height = \"100\" style = \"border:1px solid blue\">\n       </canvas>\n       <!-- canvas Tag ends here -->\n         \n   </body>\n</html> <!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n   <body>\n         \n       <!-- canvas Tag starts here -->\n       <canvas id = \"InterviewBit\" width = \"100\" \n           height = \"100\" style = \"border:1px solid blue\">\n       </canvas>\n       <!-- canvas Tag ends here -->\n         \n   </body>\n</html> <!DOCTYPE html> html <html> html <body> body <!-- canvas Tag starts here --> <canvas id = \"InterviewBit\" width = \"100\" \n           height = \"100\" style = \"border:1px solid blue\"> canvas id \"InterviewBit\" width \"100\" height \"100\" style \"border:1px solid blue\" </canvas> canvas <!-- canvas Tag ends here --> </body> body </html> html Or <!DOCTYPE HTML>\n<html>\n  <head>\n     <style>\n        #Interviewbit{border:1px solid blue;}\n     </style>\n  </head>\n  \n  <body>\n     <canvas id = \"Interviewbit\" width = \"100\" height = \"100\"></canvas>\n  </body>\n</html> <!DOCTYPE HTML>\n<html>\n  <head>\n     <style>\n        #Interviewbit{border:1px solid blue;}\n     </style>\n  </head>\n  \n  <body>\n     <canvas id = \"Interviewbit\" width = \"100\" height = \"100\"></canvas>\n  </body>\n</html> <!DOCTYPE HTML> HTML <html> html <head> head <style> style #Interviewbit{border:1px solid blue;} #Interviewbit border 1px </style> style </head> head <body> body <canvas id = \"Interviewbit\" width = \"100\" height = \"100\"> canvas id \"Interviewbit\" width \"100\" height \"100\" </canvas> canvas </body> body </html> html Output:  ",

Closures allow you to access the scope (variables and parameters) of an outer function from an inner function. Every time a JavaScript function is created, a closure is created. JavaScript closures allow you to control which variables are and are not in scope in a given function, as well as which variables are shared among siblings within the same containing scope.",

        "question": "10. What is an event loop in Node JS?",
        "answer": "Asynchronous programming in JavaScript is made possible by the event loop. With JS, all operations occur on a single thread, but we can create the illusion of multi-threading by using smart data structures. Event loop takes care of anything that's async using a queue and listener. So, when an async function has to be executed (or an I/O has to be performed), the main thread sends it to another thread, allowing v8 (Javascript engine) to continue running its code. The event loop consists of different phases with specific tasks like pending callbacks, close callbacks, timers, idle or prepare, poll, check, with different FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues. Conclusion In an era of economic uncertainty, web development is one of the most promising careers to pursue. In spite of this, web developer interviews can be intimidating, and if you are unprepared, you will become overwhelmed and lose confidence. In order to be competitive, you must be able to have a competitive edge and skill sets that set you apart from the rest. To be successful, you must have a thorough understanding and hands-on experience with integrating new technologies, CSS3, HTML5 APIs, front-end scripting language libraries, and languages like JavaScript, Python, PHP, etc. Furthermore, you must be knowledgeable about configuring applications on web servers and databases, managing SEO keywords, browser compatibility and web security.

The most efficient way, however, would be to use just a single file called styles.css (or something similar). Combining them into a single document is preferable. Loading one file is easier for a client than loading five. In order to change the style, you simply open the styles.css file, scroll down to find the appropriate section, and modify the CSS.

        "answer": "As a Web Developer, here are the top hacks for reducing load time and optimizing your web application's loading times: Image compression and optimization: Using images on your website will improve the appearance and quality of your pages. However, larger images will also slow down the loading process. Compressing and optimizing images is one of the easiest ways to improve the speed of your site. The smaller your images' file sizes, the less weight they have, which, in turn, helps your pages load faster.\nPut JavaScript and CSS in external files: When JavaScript and CSS are embedded in HTML documents, they are downloaded each time the HTML document is loaded. As a result, this does not utilize browser caching, increasing the size of HTML documents. You should always place CSS and JavaScript in external files; this is best practice and makes maintaining your site easier.\nReduce the number of redirects: A website with too many redirects will take a long time to load. HTTP request and response times are prolonged every time a page redirects. If you eliminate unnecessary redirects on your site, your page load time will be significantly reduced.\nCSS and JavaScript files should be loaded asynchronously: You have CSS and JavaScript files on your website that can be loaded synchronously or asynchronously. In synchronous loading, each file is loaded one at a time, in the order in which it appears on your web page. Asynchronous loading, on the other hand, allows multiple files to be loaded simultaneously, which can speed up the performance of a website. '\nMinify HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Your pages will load faster if you optimize how your files to load. In a similar vein, you can minify your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. You can reduce the size of files by eliminating unnecessary spaces, characters, comments, and other components. As a result, web pages will load faster with cleaner code.

        "answer": "Managing the availability of variables or objects in an application is governed by the concept of scope. In JavaScript, there are two types of scope as follows: Global Scope: A variable having global scope can be accessed from anywhere in the program. These variables that are declared outside of any function can be accessed from any place in the program. Global Scope: Example: Example: let scalerProgram = \"DataScience\"\n// code here can use scalerProgram\nfunction myScaler() {\n// code here can also use scalerProgram\n} let scalerProgram = \"DataScience\"\n// code here can use scalerProgram\nfunction myScaler() {\n// code here can also use scalerProgram\n} let \"DataScience\" // code here can use scalerProgram function myScaler() function myScaler  // code here can also use scalerProgram Local Scope: Variables with a local scope can only be accessed within the same function in which they are declared. Whenever a variable is declared inside a function, it becomes local to the function. As soon as a function begins, local variables are created and deleted when the function is executed. Local Scope Example: Example: // code here can NOT use scalerProgram\nfunction myScaler() {\n let scalerProgram = \"DataScience\";\n // code here CAN use scalerProgram\n}\n// code here can NOT use scalerProgram // code here can NOT use scalerProgram\nfunction myScaler() {\n let scalerProgram = \"DataScience\";\n // code here CAN use scalerProgram\n}\n// code here can NOT use scalerProgram // code here can NOT use scalerProgram function myScaler() function myScaler  let \"DataScience\" // code here CAN use scalerProgram // code here can NOT use scalerProgram",
