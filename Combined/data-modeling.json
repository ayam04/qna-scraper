        "question": "1) What do you understand by a data model?",
        "answer": "A data model is a set of different data elements. It specifies how they are related to each other and the real-world entity properties. Data models consist of entities. Here, entities are the objects and concepts whose data we want to track. These entities are stored in a table found in a database. For example, if a table consists of customers, products, manufacturers, buyers, and sellers, they are called potential entities. Each entity has attributes-details that the users want to track. For example, a customer's name is an attribute.",

        "question": "2) What is data modeling?",
        "answer": "Data modeling is creating data models to store in a database. It is a conceptual representation of data objects, the association between different data objects, and the rules. It also represents how the data flows. In other words, data modeling is creating a simplified diagram that contains data elements in the form of texts and symbols.",

        "question": "3) What are the different types of data models?",
        "answer": "There are mainly three types of data models:\nADVERTISEMENT\nPhysical data model: The physical data model describes how the system will be implemented using a specific DBMS system. Generally, this model is created by DBA and developers and used to demonstrate the actual implementation of the database. This framework or schema specifies how data is physically stored in the database.\nLogical data models: The logical data models define how the system should be implemented regardless of the DBMS. Data architects and business analysts typically create this model to develop a technical map of rules and data structures. It specifies the logical representation of data to exist apart from the physical storage.\nConceptual data model: The conceptual data model mainly focuses on the high-level user's view of the data. Generally, this model is created by business stakeholders and data architects to organize, scope, and define business concepts and rules. In other words, this model defines what the system should contain.",

        "answer": "There are mainly two different types of data modeling schemes used in data modeling:\nStar Schema: The star schema is the simplest style of data mart schema. This approach is most widely used to develop data warehouses and dimensional data marts. This schema contains one or more fact tables that reference any number of dimension tables.\nSnowflake Schema: In computing, the snowflake schema is a logical arrangement of tables in a multidimensional database so that the entity-relationship diagram resembles a snowflake shape. The snowflake schema is represented by centralized fact tables connected to multiple dimensions. Snowflaking is used to normalize the dimension tables in a star schema.\nNote: The star schema is an important case of the snowflake schema and is used more effectively for handling simpler queries.",

        "question": "9) What is denormalization in a database? / What do you understand by Data Denormalization? What are its advantages and disadvantages?",
        "answer": "Data Denormalization is a technique used on a previously-normalized database to increase performance. In this technique, redundant data is added to an already normalized database that enhances the read performance by sacrificing write performance.\nIn the denormalization database optimization technique, we add redundant data to one or more tables. This can help us avoid costly joins in a relational database. In other words, we can say that denormalization is the process of improving the read performance of a database by sacrificing some write performance, by adding redundant copies of data, or by grouping it.\nAdvantages of Denormalization:\nThe biggest advantage of denormalization is that it retrieves data faster because we have to do fewer joins.\nQueries used to retrieve data are generally simple and, therefore, have fewer chances of having bugs.\nIt is easy to handle since we need to look at fewer tables.\nDisadvantages of Denormalization:\nThe biggest disadvantage of denormalization is that its updates and inserts are more expensive.\nIts updates and insert code are hard to write.\nData may be inconsistent and may require more storage.\nNote: We must remember that denormalization does not mean not doing normalization. It is an optimization technique applied after doing normalization.",

It is also used to construct a data warehouse.\nIt is used to improve query performance. Sometimes we have to use queries that may require multiple tables to access data we frequently need.\nIt is used to compute commonly-needed values upfront.

        "answer": "A surrogate key is a unique key in the database used for an entity in the client's business or an object within the database. This is used when we cannot use natural keys to create a unique primary table key. In this case, the data modeler or architect decides to use surrogate or helping keys for a table in the LDM. That's why surrogate keys are also known as helping keys. A surrogate key is a substitute for natural keys.\nFollowing are some benefits of using surrogate keys:\nSurrogate keys are useful for creating SQL queries, uniquely identifying a record and good performance.\nSurrogate keys consist of numeric data types that provide excellent performance during data processing and business queries.\nSurrogate keys do not change while the row exists.\nNatural keys can be changed in the source. For example, migration to a new system, making them useless in the data warehouse. That's why surrogate keys are used.\nIf we use surrogate keys and share them across tables, we can automate the code, making the ETL process simpler.",
