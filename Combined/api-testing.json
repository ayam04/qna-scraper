The functionalities of the application would be evaluated end-to-end without the need for GUI (Graphical User Interface) which helps in detecting issues that can prove to be bigger at the time of GUI testing.\nTime and Cost Effectiveness: This is usually less time-consuming when compared to GUI testing. It also requires less code for testing the functionalities thereby making it easier to set up and get faster access to test coverage. It also results in effective cost savings for the project.\nLanguage-Independent: The data transfer between the test platform to the applications is done utilizing XML or JSON and is completely independent of the languages used in developing the systems.

As a general rule, almost 80% of the defects are found in 20% of the application modules. These risky modules can be identified by following this approach.\nHowever this principle has a problem. We might have to perform API testing repeatedly on the application which might be obstructive to finding new bugs.\nPesticide Paradox: This paradox states that if the testers use the same test cases repeatedly, then they would not be capable of finding new bugs over a period of time. Hence, the testers need to be fully equipped by reviewing and revising the test cases regularly. New test cases are more effective in finding new bugs. However, no amount of testing can ensure that the product is 100% bug-free.\nPresence of defects: Another principle of testing is that the aim of testing should be the presence of bugs and not the absence of defects. The goal of testing is to reduce the probability of finding undiscovered bugs. In case 0 defects are found, yet we cannot fully claim that our software is 100% bug-free.\nError absence fallacy: There can be an increased possibility of software being unusable even if it is 99% bug-free which can be wrong. The main focus of software testing is to ensure that the software addresses the business requirements correctly. This principle states that even if we identify and fix the defects if the software does not fulfil the business requirements, then the system is unusable.\nEarly Testing: This principle states that it is easier to fix bugs early in the software development lifecycle. Hence, it is recommended to start testing the application as early as possible.\nContext Dependent Testing: The way we test an application depending on the type of the system. We use different techniques, methodologies and test cases to test the applications depending on the type. For example, the way we test e-commerce applications is different from the way we test online streaming applications.

        "question": "9) What are the advantages of API testing?",
        "answer": "Advantages of API testing are:\nTest for core functionality: API testing provides access to the application without the user interface. The core functionality of the application will be tested before the GUI tests. This will help to detect the minor issue which can become bigger during the GUI testing.\nTime effective: API testing is less time consuming than GUI testing. Particularly, API test requires less code so it can provide better and faster test coverage compare to GUI test automation. This will reduce the cost for the testing project.\nLanguage Independent: In API testing data is exchange using XML or JSON. These transfer mode are completely language-independent, which allows users to select any code language when adopting automation test service for the project.\nEasy Integration with GUI: API tests provide highly integrable tests which is useful to perform functional GUI tests after GUI tests. Simple integration would allow new user accounts to be created within the application before GUI started.",

        "question": "10) What are the principles of an API test design?",
        "answer": "Here, are the seven principles of API test design.\nExhaustive Testing: Exhaustive testing is not possible. Instead we need optimal amount of testing which is based on the risk assessment of the application.\nDefect Clustering: Defect Clustering states that a small number of modules contain the most of the defect detected. Approximately 80% of the defect found in 20% of the modules. By experience we can identify such risky modules. But this approach has its own problems. If the same tests are repeated over and over again, eventually the same test case will no longer find new bugs.\nPesticide Paradox: Testers cannot depend on existing technique. They must have to look continually to improve the existing method to make testing more effective. But even all these hard work in testing we can never claim our product is bug free. To overcome this, test cases need to be regularly reviewed and revised add new and different test cases to help find more defects.\nTesting shows presence of defects: Testing principle states that- testing talks about the presence of defects not about the absence of defect. Software testing reduces the probability of undiscovered defects remaining in the software but even if no defects found, it is not a proof of correctness.\nBut if we work hard, taking all precautions and make our software products 99% bug free. The software does not meet the needs and requirements of the client.\nAbsence of error -fallacy: This can be possible the software which is 99% bug free is still unusable. The case can be if the system is tested for the wrong requirement. Software testing is not finding the defects but also to check that software addresses the business needs. The absence of error is fallacy i.e. finding and fixing defects does not help if the system build is unusable and doesn't fulfill the user's needs and requirements.\nEarly Testing: Testing should start as soon as possible in the software development lifecycle. So that defects in the requirement or design phase captured in the early stages. It is cheaper to fix defect in the early stages of testing. We should start finding the bug at the moment the requirements are defined.\nTesting is context dependent: Testing is context dependent that we test an e-commerce site will be different from the way we test the commercial. All the developed software's are not identical. We will use different methodology; techniques and type of testing depend on the application type.",

        "answer": "A framework or software framework is a platform for developing software applications. API framework is a foundation on which software developer can build applications for a specific platform.\nExample: A framework can include predefined classes and functions that can be used to process input, manage hardware devices and interact with system software.\nFramework is similar to an Application Programming Interface, technically framework includes API. Framework serves foundation for programming while API provides access to the elements supported by the framework. Framework also includes code libraries, compiler and other programs used in the software development process.\nAPI framework is defined by configuration file which consists the list of all APIs that is required to be activated and activated for a particular program run.",
