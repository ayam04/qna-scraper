        "question": "1. What are the features of the robot framework?",
        "answer": "Following are the features of the robot framework: Tabular structure is used for test cases: The test cases in the Robot framework are defined in a simple tabular manner using keywords. A new developer may easily comprehend and write test cases.\nKeywords: Built-in keywords are accessible with Robot Framework, as well as keywords from libraries such as the Selenium Library (open browser, close browser, maximize browser, etc.). We can also make user-defined keywords out of a mix of other user-defined keywords, built-in keywords, and library keywords. We can even pass parameters to such keywords, turning user-defined keywords into reusable functions.\nVariables: Variables such as scalar, list, and dict are supported by the Robot framework. Variables in the robot framework are simple to utilize and come in handy when constructing complicated test cases.\nLibraries: External libraries such as SeleniumLibrary, DatabaseLibrary, FTPLibrary, and httpLibrary are all supported by the Robot framework. SeleniumLibrary is widely used because it allows users to interact with browsers and aids in web application and user interface testing. The Robot framework provides its own built-in libraries for strings, dates, and integers, among other things.\nResources: Externally imported robot files with keywords can now be utilized with test cases thanks to the Robot Framework. The resources are simple to utilize and come in handy when we need to use keywords that have previously been written for other test projects.\nTest cases based on data: The Robot framework supports both keyword-driven and data-driven test scenarios. Data-driven testing uses a high-level keyword as a template for the test suite, and test cases are used to communicate data with the template's high-level keyword. It simplifies the process of testing user interfaces with various inputs.\nLogs and Reports: In the form of reports and logs, the Robot framework offers all of the data of the test suite and test case execution.

        "answer": "We commonly use files written in simple text format (usually in the .robot form, or in the format of .txt) in Robot Framework, but we can also use files written in Tab separated format or TSV. The plain text data can then be embedded in reStructured text format files. The space-separated format, in which bits of data, such as keywords and their arguments, are separated from each other with two or more spaces, is the most frequent way to construct Robot Framework data. The pipe separated format, in which the separator is the pipe character surrounded by spaces (|), is another option. The --extension option can be used to change the default extension of executed files, which is .robot. Although resource files can utilize the .robot extension, it is advised that they use the dedicated .resource extension. The UTF-8 encoding must be used to save files that contain non-ASCII characters. reStructuredText files are also supported by Robot Framework, allowing standard Robot Framework data to be inserted within code blocks. With reStructuredText files, either the .rst or .rest extension can be used, but the --extension option must be used to enable parsing when executing a directory.",

        "question": "7. What are the different types of variables in the context of the robot framework?",
        "answer": "Variables are a key component of Robot Framework, and they can be utilized in almost every test data scenario. They're most typically used as arguments for keywords in the Test Case and Keyword sections, although they're also allowed in all settings. A variable cannot be used to specify a standard keyword name, but the BuiltIn keyword Run Keyword can be used to achieve the same result. Following are the different types of variables: Scalar Variables: Scalar Variables: Scalar Variables: The scalar variable syntax like ${var} is the most popular way to use variables in Robot Framework test data. The variable name is substituted with its value as-is when this syntax is used. Variable values are often strings, but variables can also hold any object, such as numbers, lists, dictionaries, or even bespoke objects. Example: Example: *** Test Cases ***\nConstants\n   Log    Hello\n   Log    Hello, world!!\nVariables\n   Log    ${GREET}\n   Log    ${GREET}, ${NAME}!! *** Test Cases ***\nConstants\n   Log    Hello\n   Log    Hello, world!!\nVariables\n   Log    ${GREET}\n   Log    ${GREET}, ${NAME}!! The use of scalar variables is demonstrated in the example above. Both the above test cases are similar if the variables ${GREET} and ${NAME} are available and assigned to the strings Hello and world, respectively. When a scalar variable is used without any text or other variables around it, like in ${GREET} above, the variable is substituted with its value, which can be any object. If the variable isn't used alone, as in ${GREER}, ${NAME}!!, its value is transformed to a string before being concatenated with the other data. List Variables: List Variables: List Variables: When a variable, such as ${EXAMPLE}, is used as a scalar, its value is utilized exactly as it is. If a variable's value is a list or looks like a list, it can also be used as a list variable, such as @{EXAMPLE}. The list is enlarged in this scenario, and each item is sent in as a distinct argument. *** Test Cases ***\nConstants\n   Login    user    password\nList Variable\n   Login    @{CREDENTIALS} *** Test Cases ***\nConstants\n   Login    user    password\nList Variable\n   Login    @{CREDENTIALS} In the above example, the variable @{CREDENTIALS} has values [‘user’, ‘password’]. Robot Framework keeps all of its variables in one internal storage location and allows them to be used as scalars, lists, or dictionaries. If you want to use a variable as a list, its value must be a Python list or a list-like object. Strings are not allowed to be used as lists in Robot Framework, although other iterable objects like tuples and dictionaries are. Dictionary Variables: Dictionary Variables: Dictionary Variables: A dictionary variable is a variable containing a Python dictionary or a dictionary-like object. The syntax for a dictionary variable is &{EXAMPLE}. In practice, this means the dictionary is enlarged, and individual items are supplied to the keyword as named arguments. For example, *** Test Cases ***\nConstants\n   Login    user=user1    password=password1\nDict Variable\n   Login    &{CREDENTIALS} *** Test Cases ***\nConstants\n   Login    user=user1    password=password1\nDict Variable\n   Login    &{CREDENTIALS} In the above example, assuming that the variable &{CREDENTIALS} has value {‘user’: ‘user1’, ‘password’: ‘password1’}, the two test cases are equivalent. Environment Variables: Environment Variables: Environment Variables: The %{ENV_VAR_NAME} syntax in Robot Framework allows you to use environment variables in your test data. They're only allowed to use string values. By separating the variable name and the default value with an equal sign, such as %{ENV_VAR_NAME = default_value}, you can give a default value that will be used if the environment variable does not exist. Environment variables set in the operating system before the test execution are available during it, and the keywords Set Environment Variable and Delete Environment Variable, both available in the OperatingSystem library, can be used to create new ones or delete existing ones. Because environment variables are global, environment variables defined in one test case can be reused in subsequent test cases. Changes to environment variables, on the other hand, are ineffective after the test has been completed.",

Robot Framework processes data, conduct test cases, and generates logs and reports when it is started. The core framework has no knowledge of the target under test, and libraries manage all interactions with it.

    {
        "question": "2. What do you understand about test setup and teardown in the context of the robot framework?",
        "answer": "Many additional test automation frameworks provide a similar test setup and teardown capability as Robot Framework. In a nutshell, a test setup occurs prior to the execution of a test case, whereas a test teardown occurs after the execution of a test case. Setups and teardowns in the Robot Framework are essentially regular keywords with arguments. The terms \"setup\" and \"teardown\" are always used interchangeably. It is feasible to develop higher-level user keywords for this purpose if they need to handle numerous independent jobs. Alternatively, you can use the BuiltIn keyword Run Keywords to execute several keywords. In two ways, the test teardown is unique. For example, it is executed even if a test case fails, so it can be used for cleanup tasks that must be completed regardless of the status of the test case. Furthermore, even if one of the keywords in the teardown fails, all of the others are executed. The Test Setup and Test Teardown settings in the Setting section are the simplest way to specify a setup or teardown for test cases in a test case file. Each test case may additionally have its own setup and teardown. They are defined in the test case section with the [Setup] or [Teardown] parameters, and they override any conceivable Test Setup and Test Teardown options. There is no setup or teardown if there is no keyword after a [Setup] or [Teardown] setting. The value NONE can also be used to indicate that a test has no setup or teardown.",

        "question": "3. What are the different test case styles in the context of the robot framework?",
        "answer": "There are various alternative approaches to writing test cases. Test cases describing a workflow can be built using either a keyword-driven or a behaviour-driven approach. Using a data-driven approach, you may evaluate the same workflow with different input data. Keyword-driven style: Workflow tests, like the Valid Login test, are made up of a number of keywords and their possible arguments. In the Valid Login example, the system is first put into the initial state (Open Login Page), then something is done to it (Input Name, Input Password, Submit Credentials), and lastly the system is confirmed to have performed as intended (Welcome Page Should Be Open).\nData-driven design: Another technique to writing test cases is the data-driven approach, which hides the real test workflow by using only one higher-level keyword, commonly created as a user keyword. When you need to test the same scenario with varied input and/or output data, these tests come in handy. Although it would be possible to utilise the same keyword in each test, the test template functionality allows you to define the keyword just once.\nBehaviour-driven design: Test cases can also be written as requirements that non-technical project stakeholders must comprehend. The cornerstone of a technique known as Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD) or Specification by Example is a set of executable criteria.\nThe Given-When-Then approach, popularized by Behavior Driven Development, is one technique to construct these requirements/tests (BDD). The initial state is commonly specified with a keyword beginning with the word Given, the actions with a keyword beginning with When, and the expectations with a keyword beginning with Then when constructing test cases in this style. If a phase has multiple actions, a keyword beginning with And or But can be used.

        "question": "4. What do you understand about Jenkins Freestyle Project?",
        "answer": "When it comes to robot framework interview questions, this is a basic question; yet, it is critical. Jenkins' project will become increasingly important as you progress up the corporate ladder to the firm that recruited you. Jenkins' project is nothing more than a series of tasks that can be run repeatedly to obtain similar outcomes, and these stages also include the activities that must be taken once the build is finished. Freestyle refers to improvised or unrestricted performance. In Jenkins, a freestyle project is one that spans numerous operations. It could be a pipeline, a build, or a script run. A freestyle project is a common build job or assignment, according to the Jenkins wiki. Running tests, creating or packaging an application, producing a report, or even running commands are all examples of this. Data is collected before any tests are done. Jenkins can also help with this. Jenkins collects data in a variety of ways, depending on what is being accomplished and the data's intended use. For example, a real-world scenario would entail collecting application artifacts following builds. In terms of management, Jenkins enables us to send reports at any defined stage, which may include artifact information or application logs being sent to a log management entity like Elasticsearch.

It also includes extensions to simulate user interaction with browsers, as well as a distribution server for scaling browser allocation and infrastructure for W3C WebDriver implementations, which allow you to develop interchangeable code for all major web browsers.\nRobot has a large library and can be readily coupled with Selenium to automate the testing of front-end components in the browser. It's mostly a front-end component and functionality testing tool for browsers.\nIn Robot, there is no built-in way to work with fixtures, but it can be integrated with unittest and used that way. By using PyTest to write your Selenium WebDriver tests, you gain access to Pytest's rich fixture model.\nRobot Framework allows you to define a set of fixed, particular data states for a collection of tests (group-fixtures) by combining it with unittest. When using Pytest's fixture model, one can group fixtures.\nTest data generators are supported. Input data for tests is generated by data generators. The test is then performed for each piece of input data generated in this manner. The Robot Framework Faker library is a library created by Robot. It has 147 keywords that are used to generate random test data. Selenium can generate test data by making use of a library like Faker or Fake-factory.\nMocks are objects that mimic the actions of real-world items. Using mocks allows you to test a specific section of code in isolation (with other parts mocked when needed). For mocking, Robot Framework can use Python's mock library. By default, Selenium has support for mocking. Robot is a Python acceptance/functional testing framework.
