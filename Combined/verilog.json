        "answer": "In digital circuits, a D Flip-Flop (DFF) is like a tiny memory unit. It holds information and works with a clock.\nSynchronous Reset:\nImagine resetting your watch exactly at noon. That’s like a synchronous reset. It clears the flip-flop’s memory precisely when the clock ticks. Here’s a Verilog code for a D Flip-Flop with synchronous reset:\nmodule dff_sync_reset(\n    input wire clk, reset,\n    input wire d,\n    output reg q\n);\n    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)\n        if (reset)\n            q <= 1'b0; // Resetting to '0'\n        else\n            q <= d;\nendmodule\nAsynchronous Reset:\nNow, picture instantly resetting your watch, no matter what time it is. That's like an asynchronous reset. It clears the flip-flop's memory immediately, not waiting for anything else.\nHere's a Verilog code for a D Flip-Flop with asynchronous reset:\nmodule dff_async_reset(\n    input wire clk, reset,\n    input wire d,\n    output reg q\n);\n    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)\n        if (reset)\n            q <= 1'b0; // Resetting to '0'\n        else\n            q <= d;\nendmodule\nIn both cases, these bits of Verilog code describe how a memory unit works, with one type resetting at specific clock times (synchronous) and the other resetting instantly (asynchronous).",

VHDL is complex in comparison to the Verilog language.\nVerilog mainly focuses on hardware modeling but has a lower level of programming constructs. So, it is not as verbose as VHDL. VHDL is a rich and strongly typed language. It is deterministic and more verbose than Verilog.\nVerilog is more compact than VHDL. In VHDL, you have to write more lines of code.\nVerilog is weakly typed and deterministic. All data types are predefined in Verilog, and each has a bit-level representation.
