        "question": "15. What are some of the common performance bottlenecks and how do they impact your application?",
        "answer": "Bottlenecks are system obstructions that contribute to degradation in the system’s performance. They are caused either by hardware issues or coding errors that lead to a reduction of throughput under varying loads. Some of the common bottlenecks in performance are: Processor bottlenecks: These occur when the processor is overloaded and cannot perform its tasks and respond to requests on time. These can be in 2 forms:\nCPU running at above 80% capacity for a prolonged period.\nA long queue of requests for the processor.\nBoth of these forms occur when the system has insufficient memory and has continuous interruption from the I/O devices. They can be resolved by adding more RAM, increasing CPU power and improving algorithmic efficiency.\nMemory Utilization: This bottleneck occurs when the system does not have fast RAM or does not have sufficient memory. This impacts the speed of serving information to the CPU thereby slowing down the application. Whenever the device does not have enough RAM, the storage will be offloaded to SSD or HDD. These issues can be resolved by increasing the memory capacity or increasing RAM. If the RAM is very slow, then it can be replaced. Sometimes the problem can arise due to memory leak issues wherein a program does not release memory so that the system can use it. Correcting the application program to free memory also can fix the issue.\nNetwork bottlenecks: These occur when two or more devices lack the necessary bandwidth to communicate with each other. Whenever there is an overburdened server or overloaded network that causes the network to lose its integrity. These issues can be resolved by upgrading servers, network hardware like hubs, routers, access points etc.\nSoftware bottlenecks: These bottlenecks are due to the software where programs are built for handling finite tasks so that it doesn’t utilize additional RAM or CPU. This makes the program use only a single core or processor despite the availability of resources. These can be resolved by making the software program more efficient so that it can use available resources efficiently.\nDisk Usage: The slowest component in a server is long-term storage units like SSDs or HDDs that are unavoidable. The fastest long-term storage units have physical limits which makes it difficult for the programmers to troubleshoot such issues. These can be fixed by increasing RAM caching rates, reducing fragmentation issues or by addressing insufficient bandwidth by switching to faster storage units.

        "answer": "Endurance testing deals with how long the application can endure and perform well irrespective of the loads. Sometimes when an application is used for a long time, it becomes slow or inactive which is why it becomes important to conduct this testing. Endurance testing analyses all changes in the application by simulating lengthy application usage. For example, endurance testing is conducted on a Banking application where we test if it can perform normally under continuous load or large transactions for a long time.\nSpike testing deals with pushing the application to the limits by subjecting the software to the highest operation level for identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the application. Spike testing is necessary for instances when eCommerce or shopping sites launch flash sales or holiday discount deals where suddenly a large number of users will be accessing the application. If the application crashes under sudden spike every time, then it would result in a bad user experience and the users would lose faith in the application.

        "answer": "Load testing is a type of testing that analyzes the software performance when it is saddled with more than normal workloads. The load can be of any kind - data or users accessing the system or the application itself on the server’s operating system. When the load is increased, some applications tend to perform slowly (degenerate) and in some other cases, the applications run normally. Load testing determines that the applications run at optimal levels irrespective of the load given to them. \nStress testing on the other hand has a broader approach to the software’s performance. It considers the amount of data processed, time taken to process it, network connectivity levels and other applications running in the background. When the stress levels are high, software tends to crash or stop working altogether. This testing imitates the stressful environment to test the resistance of the software to operate correctly.

        "answer": "Spike Testing is conducted to determine how an application behaves when the number of users accessing the system decreases or increases abruptly. This is because generally when the number of users varies abruptly and suddenly (leading to a spike), then the system behaviour will have unexpected changes. This can be tested in JMeter using Synchronizing Timer. This is simulated by jamming the threads by synchronizing the time until the stipulated number of threads have been blocked and once that is achieved, then release the threads suddenly at once to simulate a large load.
