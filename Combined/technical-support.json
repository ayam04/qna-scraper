Method 2: Reboot your device into “Last Known Good Configuration” Method 2: Reboot your device into “Last Known Good Configuration” When a machine is restarted into the \"Last Known Good Configuration\" state, it uses a version of the Windows registry that was saved from the last time it booted correctly. All registry-related boot issues should be resolved if the last registry backup is accessible and in good form. The following are the processes for returning a PC to its previous state: Start the computer again.\nBefore proceeding, wait for the BIOS to complete POST (the screen with the manufacturer's logo and/or system details).\nContinue pressing F8 until you see a range of boot options.\nFrom the drop-down box, choose \"Last Known Good Configuration (Advanced).\"\nAfter pressing Enter, wait for the machine to boot up.

Method 4: Manually restore the registry Method 4: Manually restore the registry The defective registry can also be fixed by replacing it with a fresh copy created while Windows was being installed on the hard drive. This step will restore the system to a state that may differ significantly from its present state; nevertheless, user data will still be accessible. This technique should be avoided if the system has an OEM-installed operating system because the system registry hive upon OEM installations generates passwords and user accounts that did not even exist previously. To begin, create a backup of all existing registry files, which can be restored if anything goes wrong. The current registry is then deleted and replaced with a fresh one from the C:WindowsRepair folder. After the boot procedure is complete, you have the option of backing up all user data and reinstalling Windows from scratch or specifically restoring the system registry to a more current version supported by System Restore.

It is responsible for the actual physical connection between the devices. This layer contains information in the form of bits and transmits individual bits from one node to the next. After receiving the data, this layer gets a signal received, converts it into 0s and 1s, and sends them to the Data Link layer.\nData Link Layer: The data link layer is used to transmit messages form node to node. This layer ensures that the data transfer is error-free from one node to another over the physical layer. The Data Link Layer is divided into two sub-layers: Logical Link Control (LLC) and Media Access Control (MAC).\nNetwork Layer: The network layer is responsible for transmitting data from one host to the other located in different networks. It is also used for packet routing.\nTransport Layer: The transport layer is used to make communication between the application layer and network layer. The data in the transport layer is called Segments. It ensures the End to End Delivery of the complete message and provides an acknowledgment of the successful data transmission, and re-transmits the data if an error is found.\nSession Layer: The Session layer is used for connection establishment, maintenance of sessions, and authentication. It is also responsible for ensuring security.\nPresentation Layer: The Presentation layer is responsible for extracting the data from the application layer and manipulating it as per the required format to transmit over the network. The main functions of the presentation layer are translation, encryption/ decryption, and compression. It is also called the translation layer.\nApplication Layer: The Application layer is the topmost layer of the OSI Reference Model. The network applications implement it. These applications produce the data, which has to be transferred over the network. This layer also acts as a window for the application services to access the web and display the received information to the user. That's why this layer is called the desktop layer.",

API stands for Application Programming Interface.\nSDK is a software development kit that offers tools, code samples, libraries, processes, guides or relevant documents for creating software applications on specific platforms. The API is an interface used to allow the software to interact with each other.\nAn SDK is a complete workshop that can allow us to create beyond the scope of API. An API can translate and transfer two different instruction sets for mutual understanding.\nAn SDK is almost the origin point of nearly every program that we use. The API comes in many sizes and shapes. Sometimes, it is required even to copy paste.\nSometimes, SDK contains API. API is used for different functions in the World Wide Web. The Web API facilitates interaction between disparate systems, especially for specific cases.",
