While it may be interesting to experience life in a different era, the future holds more promise for continued innovation to solve significant challenges we still face today, like sustainable energy solutions, cures for diseases, and more breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and automation.\nFurthermore, the future is more diverse, open-minded, and full of potential yet unknown experiences I could never foresee today. My curiosity about what the next 100 years may bring and the knowledge and global connectivity that will emerge make the future a more compelling place to explore in theory.

Conclusion In summary, behavioral interview questions are based on how you are likely to behave when faced with certain situations. The hiring manager will use the behavioral interview, along with a coding test and a technical interview, to determine whether or not your past performance will assist you in putting your best foot forward in your new role. To that end, you should always come prepared for an interview. Moreover, you should strive to provide real answers. One of the other great tips would be to pay attention to the company and think about some solutions you can offer. Tech startups strive to hire employees that can help them increase revenue while reducing costs. You will be in high demand if you can prove that through examples and insights. If you cannot come up with any specific situation or challenge as a response to a behavioral question, then simply make sure to explain why you are unable to do that. Being humble, open, and professional will go a long way over making something up in an attempt to appear impressive.
