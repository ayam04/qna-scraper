        "question": "2. Can you provide some insight into the history of Google?",
        "answer": "Google was launched in September 1988 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Initially, Google began as a research project called “Backrub,” which aimed to develop a new way of ranking web pages based on their relevance and importance. Beginning in the early 2000s, Google started to swiftly grow and provide several new goods and services, such as Google Images, Google News, and Google Maps. As one of the biggest IPOs in history, Google’s first public offering in 2004 raised $1.67 billion.\nGoogle has made significant investments in R&D while expanding its presence into new industries over the years. It has also continued to grow and innovate. Google is one of the biggest and most well-known technology businesses in the world right now, with a market valuation of over $1 trillion and tens of thousands of employees working for it all over the world.",

        "question": "11. What exactly are the HTTP and HTTPS protocols?",
        "answer": "HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol, and it outlines the set of rules and standards that govern how information is sent on the World Wide Web (WWW). It facilitates communication between web browsers and servers. It is a stateless protocol, which means that each command is independent of the previous command. TCP provides the foundation for HTTP, which is an application layer protocol. Port 80 is the default.\nHTTPS stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure. It is a sophisticated and secure variant of HTTP. To offer security on top of HTTP, the SSL/TLS protocol is utilized. It secures transactions by encrypting communication and also assists in securely identifying network servers.\nGo through these HR Interview Questions to crack your interview!",

        "answer": "Both a stack and a queue are abstract data types for storing and retrieving information in a certain sequence. The order in which elements are added and removed differs among them.\nA stack is a data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle. This indicates that the element introduced last is the first to be removed. Consider a cafeteria plate stack: the last plate placed on the stack is the first to be removed from the top.\nA queue, on the other hand, is a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) data structure. This means that the first piece added to the queue is the first to be eliminated. Consider a queue of people waiting for a bus: the first person to arrive is the first to board.",

Edges can be directed or undirected, and they may carry weight or cost.\nA graph can be used to depict a variety of real-world issues, including social networks, road networks, computer networks, and genealogical trees. The vertices of a graph represent the entities or items being modeled (for example, people, cities, routers, or genes), while the edges reflect the relationships or connections between them (for example, friendships, roadways, links, or genetic inheritance).",

        "question": "15. What is normalization, and why is it important in database design?",
        "answer": "Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and reliance. It entails dividing a huge table into smaller tables and building relationships between them to guarantee that each table represents a single entity and that each attribute in a table is reliant on the primary key of that table.\nNormalization levels include the first normal form (1NF), the second normal form (2NF), the third normal form (3NF), and further levels of normalization. Each level of normalization builds on the one before it, intending to minimize redundancy and reliance while increasing data consistency and integrity. Normalization is a critical part of database design, and a thorough understanding of normalization principles is required for developing successful and efficient databases.\nGo through these Behavioural Interview Questions to crack your interview!\nAdvanced Google Interview Questions for Experienced",

        "question": "16. What is denormalization, and when should we use it in database design?",
        "answer": "Denormalization is the process of adding redundant data to one or more tables to purposefully introduce redundancy into a database. Denormalization is intended to increase query performance by minimizing the number of joins required to get data.\nDenormalization may be appropriate in situations such as:\nWhen query performance is a top priority: Denormalization can enhance query speed by lowering the number of joins required to get data. This is especially crucial in circumstances where queries must be completed fast, such as high-traffic websites or real-time apps.\nWhen data is read more often than it is updated: Denormalization is most successful when data is read more frequently than it is changed. When data is rarely updated yet regularly accessed, denormalization can bring considerable performance gains.\nWhen there is a choice between performance and data consistency: Denormalization includes the introduction of redundancy into a database, which can make maintaining data consistency more challenging. However, in cases when efficiency is paramount and data consistency is secondary, denormalization may be a reasonable solution.\nWhen working with huge datasets: In some circumstances, normalizing large datasets might result in complex data models with many tables and relationships. In many cases, denormalization can simplify the data model and make it easier to deal with.",
