        "question": "2. Explain Snowflake Architecture.",
        "answer": "The Snowflake architecture is a hybrid of shared-disk (A common disk or storage device is shared by all computing nodes) and shared-nothing (Each computing node has a private memory and storage space) database architecture in order to combine the best of both. Snowflake utilizes a central data repository for persistent data, which is available to all compute nodes similar to a shared-disk architecture. But, equally, as with shared-nothing architectures, Snowflake uses massively parallel computing (MPP) clusters for query processing, in which each node stores part of the whole data set locally.   The Snowflake architecture is divided into three key layers as shown below: Database Storage Layer: Once data has been loaded into Snowflake, this layer reorganizes that data into a specific format like columnar, compressed, and optimized format. The optimized data is stored in cloud storage.\nQuery Processing Layer: In the processing layer, queries are executed using virtual warehouses. Virtual warehouses are independent MPP (Massively Parallel Processing) compute clusters comprised of multiple compute nodes that Snowflake allocates from cloud providers. Due to the fact that virtual warehouses do not share their compute resources with each other, their performance is independent of each other.\nCloud Services Layer: It provides services to administer and manage a Snowflake data cloud, such as access control, authentication, metadata management, infrastructure management, query parsing, optimization, and many more.

        "question": "3. What do you mean by virtual warehouse?",
        "answer": "A virtual warehouse is basically a collection of computing resources (like CPU, memory, Solid state drive, etc.) that customers can access to run queries, load data, and perform other DML (Data Manipulation Language) and SQL (Structured Query Language) operations. For example, it provides memory, temporary storage, and CPU resources that can be used for DML operations and SQL execution. You can use this independent compute cluster at any time and then turn it off when not needed. You are charged (paid) for each virtual warehouse you run, their size, and how long they run. Virtual warehouses do not share their compute resources with each other, and therefore, their performance is independent of each other.

Data that needs to be loaded or stored within Snowflake is stored either elsewhere in the other cloud regions like in AWS (Amazon Web Service) S3, GCP (Google Cloud Platform), or Azure, or is stored internally within Snowflake. When data is stored in another cloud region, this is known as an external stage; when it is stored inside a snowflake, it is known as an internal stage. Internal stages can be further categorized as follows: User stages: Each of these stages pertains to a specific user, so they'll be assigned to every user by default for storing files.\nTable stages: Each of these stages pertains to a specific database table, so they'll be assigned to every table by default.\nInternal named stages: Compared to the user or table stages, these stages offer a greater degree of flexibility.

In OLTP (Online Transaction Processing), data is collected, stored, and processed from real-time transactions, but in OLAP (Online Analytical Processing), complex queries are used to evaluate aggregated historical data from OLTP systems. Snowflake is not designed to handle much updating and inserting of small amounts of data like a transactional database would. Snowflake, for instance, cannot handle referential integrity because, even though it supports integrity and other constraints, they are not enforced except the NOT NULL constraint that is always enforced.

The optimized data is then stored in the cloud storage. Snowflake manages all aspects of storing these data, including file structure, size, statistics, compression, metadata, etc. Snowflake data objects aren't visible to customers or users. Users can only access data by performing SQL queries on Snowflake. Snowflake uses a columnar format to optimize and store data within the storage layer. With it, data is stored in columns instead of rows, allowing for an analytical querying method and improving database performance. With Columnar databases, business intelligence will be easier and more accurate. Compared to row-level operations, column-level operations are faster and use fewer resources than row-level operations.   Above is an example of a table with 24 rows divided into four micro-partitions, arranged and sorted by column. As the data is divided into micro-partitions, Snowflake can first remove those micro-partitions not relevant to the query, followed by pruning the remaining micro-partitions by column. The result is fewer records traversed, resulting in significantly faster response times.",

Snowflake Compression has the following advantages: Compression lowers storage costs compared with original cloud storage.\nOn-disk caches do not incur storage costs.\nIn general, data sharing and cloning involve no storage expenses.

        "question": "10. Explain Snowflake caching and write its type.",
        "answer": "Consider an example where a query takes 15 minutes to run or execute. Now, if you were to repeat the same query with the same frequently used data, later on, you would be doing the same work and wasting resources.\nAlternatively, Snowflake caches (stores) the results of each query you run, so whenever a new query is submitted, it checks if a matching query already exists, and if it did, it uses the cached results rather than running the new query again. Due to Snowflake's ability to fetch the results directly from the cache, query times are greatly reduced.  Types of Caching in Snowflake Query Results Caching: It stores the results of all queries executed in the past 24 hours.\nLocal Disk Caching: It is used to store data used or required for performing SQL queries.  It is often referred to as\nRemote Disk Cache: It holds results for long-term use. Query Results Caching: It stores the results of all queries executed in the past 24 hours. Local Disk Caching: It is used to store data used or required for performing SQL queries.  It is often referred to as Remote Disk Cache: It holds results for long-term use.

        "question": "11. What are different snowflake editions?",
        "answer": "Snowflake offers multiple editions to meet your organization's specific needs. In every subsequent edition, either new features are introduced or a higher level of service is provided. It's easy to switch editions as your organization's needs change. The following are some of the Snowflake Editions:   Standard Edition: This is Snowflake's entry-level offering, which allows full access to all of Snowflake's standard features. This edition strikes a good balance between features, level of support, and price.\nEnterprise Edition: With Enterprise Edition, you get all the features and services of Standard Edition, but with some extra features designed to meet the needs of large-scale enterprises.\nBusiness-critical Edition: Previously known as Enterprise for Sensitive Data (ESD), Business Critical Edition offers even more advanced levels of data security for organizations that deal with highly sensitive data. This edition includes all the features and services of the Enterprise Edition, plus enhanced security and data protection.\nVirtual Private Snowflake (VPS): With this edition, organizations with strict security requirements, like financial institutions and companies that collect, analyze, and share highly sensitive data, can get the highest level of security.

        "question": "12. What do you mean by zero-copy cloning in Snowflake?",
        "answer": "Zero-copy cloning is one of the great features of Snowflake. It basically allows you to duplicate the source object without making a physical copy of it or adding additional storage costs to it. A snapshot of the data in a source object is taken when a clone (cloned object) is created, and it is made available to the cloned object. Cloned objects are independent of the source object and are therefore writable, and any changes made to either object are not reflected in the other. The keyword CLONE allows you to copy tables, schemas, databases without actually copying any data. Zero copy cloning syntax in Snowflake Zero copy cloning syntax in Snowflake In order to clone an entire production database for development purposes: In order to clone an entire production database for development purposes: CREATE DATABASE Dev CLONE Prod; CREATE DATABASE Dev CLONE Prod; In order to clone a schema In order to clone a schema CREATE SCHEMA Dev.DataSchema1 CLONE Prod.DataSchema1; CREATE SCHEMA Dev.DataSchema1 CLONE Prod.DataSchema1; In order to clone a single table: In order to clone a single table: CREATE TABLE C CLONE Dev.public.C; CREATE TABLE C CLONE Dev.public.C;",
