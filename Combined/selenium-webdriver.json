        "question": "11. In Xpath, what is the difference between \"/\" and \"//\"?",
        "answer": "Single Slash \"/\" - A single slash is used to create an Xpath with an absolute path, i.e., the XPath will begin with the document node/start node. For example, Single Slash \"/\" - A single slash is used to create an Xpath with an absolute path, i.e., the XPath will begin with the document node/start node. For example, Single Slash \"/\" Absolute XPath: /html/body/div/div/form/input Absolute XPath: /html/body/div/div/form/input Here, /html is the root html node. Double Slash \"//\" - The double slash is used to construct an Xpath with a relative path, which means the XPath can start selection from anywhere on the page. For example, Double Slash \"//\" - The double slash is used to construct an Xpath with a relative path, which means the XPath can start selection from anywhere on the page. For example, Double Slash \"//\" Relative XPath: //input[@id = 'email'] Relative XPath: //input[@id = 'email'] Here, we can locate an input having id = ‘email’ present anywhere in the document object model (DOM).",

        "question": "9. Explain basic steps of Selenium testing and its widely used commands via a practical application.",
        "answer": "Selenium testing can be divided into the following seven basic elements: 1. Creating an instance of a Webdriver: This is the first step for all the usages of a Selenium webdriver API. An instance of a webdriver interface is created using a constructor of a particular browser. This webdriver instance is used to invoke methods and access other interfaces. The following are the most commonly used commands for initializing a web driver: 1. Creating an instance of a Webdriver Firefox:\nWebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();\nChrome:\nWebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();\nSafari Driver:\nWebDriver driver = new SafariDriver();\nInternet Explorer:\nWebDriver driver = new InternetExplorerDriver(); Firefox:\nWebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();\nChrome:\nWebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();\nSafari Driver:\nWebDriver driver = new SafariDriver();\nInternet Explorer:\nWebDriver driver = new InternetExplorerDriver(); 2. Navigating to a webpage: The second step after initializing an instance of a webdriver, is to navigate to a particular webpage you want to test. The following are the most commonly used commands for webpage navigation: 2. Navigating to a webpage: Navigate to URL: \ndriver.get(“https://www.interviewbit.com”) \ndriver.navigateo.to(“https://www.interviewbit.com”)\nRefresh page:\ndriver.navigate().refresh()\nNavigate forward in browser history:\ndriver.navigate().forward()\nNavigate backward in browser history:\ndriver.navigate().backward() Navigate to URL: \ndriver.get(“https://www.interviewbit.com”) \ndriver.navigateo.to(“https://www.interviewbit.com”)\nRefresh page:\ndriver.navigate().refresh()\nNavigate forward in browser history:\ndriver.navigate().forward()\nNavigate backward in browser history:\ndriver.navigate().backward() 3. Locating an HTML element on the webpage: To interact with a web element and perform actions on it like clicking a button or entering text, we first need to locate the desired elements such as the button or the textbox on the web page. The following are the most commonly used commands for web element navigation: 3. Locating an HTML element on the webpage: Locating by ID:\ndriver.findElement(By.id(\"q\")).sendKeys(\"Selenium 3\");\nLocation by Name:\ndriver.findElement(By.name(\"q\")).sendKeys (\"Selenium 3\");\nLocation by Xpath:\ndriver.findElement(By.xpath(\"//input[@id==’q’])).sendKeys(\"Selenium 3\");\nLocating Hyperlinks by Link Text:\ndriver.FindElement(By.LinkText(\"edit this page\")).Click();\nLocating by ClassName\ndriver.findElement(By.className(\"profileheader\"));\nLocating by TagName\ndriver.findElement(By.tagName(\"select')).click();\nLocating by LinkText\ndriver.findElement(By.linkText(\"NextPage\")).click();\nLocating by PartialLinkText\ndriverlindElement(By.partialLinkText(\" NextP\")).click(); Locating by ID:\ndriver.findElement(By.id(\"q\")).sendKeys(\"Selenium 3\");\nLocation by Name:\ndriver.findElement(By.name(\"q\")).sendKeys (\"Selenium 3\");\nLocation by Xpath:\ndriver.findElement(By.xpath(\"//input[@id==’q’])).sendKeys(\"Selenium 3\");\nLocating Hyperlinks by Link Text:\ndriver.FindElement(By.LinkText(\"edit this page\")).Click();\nLocating by ClassName\ndriver.findElement(By.className(\"profileheader\"));\nLocating by TagName\ndriver.findElement(By.tagName(\"select')).click();\nLocating by LinkText\ndriver.findElement(By.linkText(\"NextPage\")).click();\nLocating by PartialLinkText\ndriverlindElement(By.partialLinkText(\" NextP\")).click(); 4. Performing actions on an HTML element: Once we have located the HTML element, the next step is interacting with it. The following are the most commonly used commands for performing actions on an HTML elements: 4. Performing actions on an HTML element: Entering a username\nusernameElement.sendKeys(\"InterviewBit\");\nEntering a password\npasswordElement.sendKeys(\"Raw\");\nSubmitting a text input element\npasswordElement.submit();\nSubmitting a form element:\nformElement.submit(); Entering a username\nusernameElement.sendKeys(\"InterviewBit\");\nEntering a password\npasswordElement.sendKeys(\"Raw\");\nSubmitting a text input element\npasswordElement.submit();\nSubmitting a form element:\nformElement.submit(); 5. Anticipating browser response from the action: Once an action is performed, anticipating a response from the browser to test comes under this step. It takes a second or two for the action to reach the browser, and hence wait is often required for this step. There are two main types of wait conditions: 5. Anticipating browser response from the action: Implicit Wait: It sets a fixed, definite time for all the webdriver interactions. It’s slightly unreliable as web driver response times are usually unpredictable. Eg: Implicit Wait: driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS); driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS); Explicit Wait: This type of wait condition sets an expected condition to occur on the web page or a maximum wait time for all the webdriver interactions. Eg: Explicit Wait: WebElement messageElement = wait.until(      ExpectedConditions.presenceOfElementLocated(By.id(\"loginResponse\")) ); WebElement messageElement = wait.until(      ExpectedConditions.presenceOfElementLocated(By.id(\"loginResponse\")) ); 6. Running tests and recording their results using a test framework: in this step, we run tests in an automated test script to evaluate an application's function and performance. Various test frameworks are used for this step, such as: 6. Running tests and recording their results using a test framework: JUnit for Java\nNUnit for C#\nUnittest or Pyunit for Python\nRUnit for Ruby JUnit for Java NUnit for C# Unittest or Pyunit for Python RUnit for Ruby Most frameworks use some sort of asset statement to verify their test results from the expected results. Eg: assertEquals (expectedMessage, actualMessage); assertEquals (expectedMessage, actualMessage); 7. Concluding a test: In this step, we conclude a test by invoking a quit method on the driver variable. This step closes all the webpages, quits the WebDriver server, and releases the driver. Eg: 7. Concluding a test: driver.quit(); driver.quit(); The following is an example of an app that covers all the steps mentioned above: import org.openqa.selenium.By,\nimport org.openqa.selenium.WebElement,\nimport org.openqa.selenium.support.ni.ExpectedConditiof, import org.openqa.selenium.support.ni.WebOriverWait,\nimport org.junit.Assert;\npublic class Example {\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n// Creating a driver instance\nWebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(),\n// Navigate to a web page\n­driver.get(\"http://www.foo.com\");\n// Enter text to submit the form\nWebElement usernameElement = driver.findElement( By.name(\"username\"));\nWebElement passwordElement = driver.findElement(By.name(”password\"));\nWebElement formElement = driver.findElement(By.id(”loginForm\"));\nusernameElement.sendKeys(\"Scaler Academy\");\npasswordElement.sendKeys(\"Raw\");\nformElement.submit();      // submit by form element\n\n//Putting an explicit wait\nWebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10);\nWebElement messageElement = wait.until(\n      ExpectedConditions.presenceofElementLocated(By.id(”loginResponse\")) \n      ) ;\n// Run a test\nString message              = messageElement.getrept();\nString successMsg      = \"Welcome to foo.

        "question": "10. What do you understand about the Page Object Model in the context of Selenium? What are its advantages?",
        "answer": "Page Object Model (POM) is a design pattern that generates an Object Repository for web UI elements and is widely used in test automation. The paradigm has the advantage of reducing code duplication and improving test maintenance. According to this paradigm, each web page in the application should have its own Page Class. This Page class will identify the web page's WebElements and also has Page methods that operate on those WebElements. The names of these methods should correspond to the tasks they perform, for example, if a loader is waiting for the payment gateway to appear, the POM method name could be waitForPaymentScreenDisplay(). waitForPaymentScreenDisplay() The following are the advantages of the Page Object Model (POM) : According to the Page Object Design Pattern, user interface activities and flows should be separated from verification. Our code is clearer and easier to understand as a result of this notion.\nThe second advantage is that the object repository is independent of test cases, allowing us to reuse the same object repository with different tools. For example, we can use Selenium to combine Page Object Model with TestNG/JUnit for functional testing and JBehave/Cucumber for acceptability testing.\nBecause of the reusable page methods in the POM classes, code gets less and more efficient.\nMethods are given more realistic names that can be easily associated with the UI operation. If we land on the home page after clicking the button, the function name will be 'gotoHomePage()'.

        "answer": "In such types of questions, the interviewer wants to assess how clear your understanding is of the framework. It is a good practice to explain the code while you write it so that the interviewer is engaged at all points and does not feel left out. We will be considering an example on MakeMyTrip.   Here, we will be using the chrome browser and so we will be implementing the code for the chrome browser only. You can implement similar code for firefox and other browsers as well.

        "question": "13. What do you understand about broken links? How can you detect broken links in Selenium? Explain properly with code.",
        "answer": "Links or URLs that are not reachable are known as broken links. They may be unavailable or inoperable due to a server issue. A URL's status will always be 2xx, indicating that it is legitimate. There are a variety of HTTP status codes, each with its own set of functions. HTTP status 4xx and 5xx indicate an invalid request. The 4xx class of status codes is used for client-side errors, while the 5xx class is used for server response errors.   You should always check for broken links on your site to ensure that the user does not end up on an error page. If the rules aren't updated appropriately, or the requested resources aren't available on the server, the error will occur. Manual link checking is a time-consuming task because each web page may have a huge number of links, and the process must be performed for each page. To find broken links in Selenium, follow the instructions below. Using the <a> (anchor) tag, collect all of the links on a web page.\nFor each link, send an HTTP request.\nMake that the HTTP response code is correct.\nBased on the HTTP response code, determine whether the link is genuine or not.\nRepeat the procedure for all of the links that were captured in the first step.

AJAX allows a web page to obtain little quantities of data from the server without having to completely reload the page. Without reloading the page, AJAX sends HTTP requests from the client to the server and then processes the server's answer. Wait commands may not work with AJAX controls. It's only that the page itself is not going to refresh. The essential information may show on the web page without refreshing the browser when you click on a submit button. It may load in a fraction of a second, or it may take longer. We have no control over how long it takes for pages to load. In Selenium, the easiest way to deal with circumstances like this is to employ dynamic waits (i.e., WebDriverWait in combination with ExpectedCondition)\nThe following are some of the approaches that are available:  1. titleIs() – The anticipated condition looks for a specific title on a page. titleIs() wait.until(ExpectedConditions.titleIs(\"Big Sale of the Year\")); wait.until(ExpectedConditions.titleIs(\"Big Sale of the Year\")); 2. elementToBeClickable() – The desired condition requires that an element be clickable, which means that it must be present/displayed/visible on the screen and enabled. elementToBeClickable() wait.until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.xpath(\"xpath\"))); wait.until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.xpath(\"xpath\"))); 3. alertIsPresent() – The expected condition anticipates the appearance of an alert box. alertIsPresent() wait.until(ExpectedConditions.alertIsPresent())!=null); wait.until(ExpectedConditions.alertIsPresent())!=null); 4. textToBePresentInElement() – The anticipated condition looks for a string pattern in an element. textToBePresentInElement() wait.until(ExpectedConditions.textToBePresentInElement(By.id(\"text\"),\"text to be found\"); wait.until(ExpectedConditions.textToBePresentInElement(By.id(\"text\"),\"text to be found\");",

        "question": "2. How to create an Object Repository in your project?",
        "answer": "There is an Object Repository notion in QTP (Quick Test Professional). By default, when a user records a test, the objects and their properties are saved in an Object Repository. This Object Repository is used by QTP to playback scripts. There is no default Object Repository concept in Selenium. This isn't to say that Selenium doesn't have an Object Repository. Even if there isn't one by default, we could make our own. Quick Test Professional Objects are referred to as locators in Selenium (such as ID, Name, Class Name, Tag Name, Link Text, Partial Link Text, XPath, and CSS). A collection of objects is referred to as an object repository. Placing all the locators in a separate file is one technique to construct an Object Repository (i.e., properties file). The ideal method, however, is to use Page Object Model. Each web page is represented as a class in the Page Object Model Design Pattern. A class contains all of the items associated with a specific page of a web application.",

        "question": "3. What are the different types of waits that WebDriver supports?",
        "answer": "  1. Implicit Wait: Implicit wait instructs Selenium to wait a specified amount of time before throwing a \"No such element\" exception (One of the WebDriver Exceptions is NoSuchElementException, which occurs when the locators indicated in the Selenium Program code is unable to locate the web element on the web page). 1. Implicit Wait: Before throwing an exception, the Selenium WebDriver is told to wait for a particular amount of time. WebDriver will wait for the element after this time has been set before throwing an exception. Implicit Wait is activated and remains active for the duration of the browser's open state. Its default setting is 0, and the following protocol must be used to define the specific wait duration. Its Syntax is as follows: driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(TimeOut, TimeUnit.SECONDS); driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(TimeOut, TimeUnit.SECONDS); 2. Explicit Wait:  Explicit wait tells the WebDriver to wait for specific conditions before throwing an \"ElementNotVisibleException\" exception. The Explicit Wait command tells the WebDriver to wait until a certain condition occurs before continuing to execute the code. Setting Explicit Wait is crucial in circumstances when certain items take longer to load than others. 2. Explicit Wait: If an implicit wait command is specified, the browser will wait the same amount of time before loading each web element. This adds to the time it takes to run the test script. Explicit waiting is smarter, but it can only be used for specific parts. It is, nonetheless preferable to implicit wait since it allows the programme to stop for dynamically loaded Ajax items. Its Syntax is as follows: WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(WebDriver Reference, TimeOut); WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(WebDriver Reference, TimeOut); 3. Fluent Wait: It is used to inform the WebDriver how long to wait for a condition and how often we want to check it before throwing an \"ElementNotVisibleException\" exception. In Selenium, Fluent Wait refers to the maximum amount of time that a Selenium WebDriver will wait for a condition (web element) to become visible. 3. Fluent Wait: It also specifies how often WebDriver will check for the presence of the condition before throwing the \"ElementNotVisibleException.\" To put it another way, Fluent Wait searches for a web element at regular intervals until it timeouts or the object is found. When engaging with site items that take longer to load, Fluent Wait instructions come in handy. This is a common occurrence with Ajax apps. It is possible to establish a default polling period while using Fluent Wait. During the polling time, the user can configure the wait to ignore any exceptions. Because they don't wait out the complete duration defined in the code, fluent waits are also known as Smart Waits. Its Syntax is as follows: Wait wait = new FluentWait(WebDriver reference).withTimeout(timeout, SECONDS).pollingEvery(timeout, SECONDS).ignoring(Exception.class); Wait wait = new FluentWait(WebDriver reference).withTimeout(timeout, SECONDS).pollingEvery(timeout, SECONDS).ignoring(Exception.class);",

        "answer": "  On a high level, the Selenium webdriver communicates with the browser and does not transform commands into JavaScript. Our Java or Python code will be transmitted as an API get and post request in the JSON wire protocol. The browser webdriver interacts with the real browser as an HTTP Request, as mentioned in the previous answer. To receive HTTP requests, each Browser Driver utilizes an HTTP server. When the URL reaches the Browser Driver, it will send the request via HTTP to the real browser. The commands in your Selenium script will be executed on the browser after this is completed.\nIf the request is a POST request, the browser will perform an action. If the request is a GET request, the browser will generate the corresponding response. The request will then be delivered to the browser driver through HTTP, and the browser driver will send it to the user interface via JSON Wire Protocol. Learn More.

One way to test responsive web design with Selenium is by using the Selenium WebDriver API to set the browser's viewport size and then test the page's layout and functionality. Another way is to use a third-party library such as Selenium-Responsive-Testing which allows you to test how the page behaves on different devices and screen sizes.

        "question": "7. What are the areas where Selenium can improve its features?",
        "answer": "Selenium has a wide range of capabilities, but some areas where it could see the benefit in extending its features include: Mobile testing: Selenium has limited support for mobile testing. It can automate web applications on mobile browsers, but it does not support automating native mobile applications.\nVisual testing: Selenium is mainly used for functional testing, but it does not have built-in support for visual testing. Visual testing compares the look and feel of the application to a pre-approved design and helps in identifying issues related to layout, alignment, and font.\nCross-browser testing: Selenium supports a wide range of browsers, but there are still some browsers that are not fully supported or have limited support.\nTest reports and analysis: Selenium's test reporting capabilities are basic and it does not provide advanced test analytics features like test coverage, flaky test detection, and root cause analysis.\nPerformance testing: Selenium is mainly used for functional testing, but it does not have built-in support for performance testing. Performance testing can help to measure the responsiveness, stability, and scalability of the application under test.\nContinuous Integration: Selenium does not provide out-of-the-box support for continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) pipeline, it needs to be integrated with other tools to automate the test execution in CI/CD pipeline.

        "question": "8. Can you explain what Page Factory is?",
        "answer": "Page Factory is a design pattern used to create an object repository for web elements in Selenium WebDriver. It's an extension of the Page Object Model design pattern, which is used to create a centralized repository for web elements. It uses annotations to identify and initialize web elements at runtime and make the code more readable and maintainable by separating the test code from the technical details of locating web elements. In order to use Page Factory, you need to create a class for each web page and define web elements in that class using the @FindBy annotation it also contains methods for interacting with the web elements.",

        "answer": "Yes, it is possible to open pop-up windows with Selenium. Selenium WebDriver provides methods to interact with browser windows, so you can use Selenium to open new windows, switch between windows, and close windows. You can open a new window using the window_handles method, and switch to the new window using the switch_to.window() method. Once you have switched to the new window, you can interact with the elements on the pop-up window just like you would interact with elements on the main window. You can also use the Alert class of Selenium WebDriver to handle JavaScript alerts and confirmations. It's worth noting that, while some browsers may block pop-ups by default, you need to configure the browser settings to allow pop-ups for the testing website. It's also important to use explicit waits to handle the dynamic nature of the web pages and pop-ups, as the time taken for a pop-up window to load may vary depending on the browser, internet connection, and other factors.",

The build() method is used to construct and return an instance of the ActionChains class, which is a container for a series of actions. However, if you don't call build(), the actions will be performed immediately when you call perform(). actions.move_to_element(element).click().perform() actions.move_to_element(element).click().perform() The above line of code is an example of using perform() without calling build(). The move_to_element(), click() methods are chained together and the perform() method is used to execute all the chained actions. However, it is important to note that, perform() method is used to execute all the chained actions only after calling build() when you are chaining multiple actions together and want to execute them together.",

        "answer": "StaleElementReferenceException is an exception that is thrown in Selenium WebDriver when a web element that was previously found on a web page is no longer available or has been deleted from the DOM (Document Object Model). This can happen if the web page has been refreshed, the element has been removed or replaced, or the element's parent element has been removed or replaced. This exception occurs when the element is no longer attached to the DOM, which means that the element can no longer be interacted with using the WebDriver. There are a few ways to overcome this exception: Re-find the element: You can re-find the element by using the WebDriver's find_element or find_elements methods again. Re-find the element: You can re-find the element by using the WebDriver's find_element or find_elements methods again. Re-find the element: try:\n    element.click()\nexcept StaleElementReferenceException:\n    element = driver.find_element_by_id('element_id')\n    element.click() try:\n    element.click()\nexcept StaleElementReferenceException:\n    element = driver.find_element_by_id('element_id')\n    element.click() Wait for the element to be available: You can use explicit waits such as WebDriverWait and ExpectedConditions to wait for the element to be available before interacting with it. Wait for the element to be available: You can use explicit waits such as WebDriverWait and ExpectedConditions to wait for the element to be available before interacting with it. Wait for the element to be available: from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.by import By\nfrom selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait\n\ntry:\n    element.click()\nexcept StaleElementReferenceException:\n    wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 10)\n    element = wait.until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, 'element_id')))\n    element.click() from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.by import By\nfrom selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait\n\ntry:\n    element.click()\nexcept StaleElementReferenceException:\n    wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 10)\n    element = wait.until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, 'element_id')))\n    element.click() Refresh the page: You can refresh the page using the refresh() method of the WebDriver instance and then re-find the element.

Only one time in the code is implicit wait specified. Throughout the driver object instance, it will remain the same. Explicit wait is used in the code whenever it is required. At the time of execution, this wait will be called. It's a conditional waiting period. Wherever explicit wait is applied, it will supersede the implicit wait. As a result, Explicit Wait takes precedence over Implicit Wait. Explicit Wait takes precedence over Implicit Wait",

        "answer": "Test design techniques are the methods or strategies used to design and create test cases for a software application. Some common test design techniques include: Black Box Testing: Testing the functionality of the software without looking into the internal structure or code.\nWhite Box Testing: Testing the internal structure or code of the software.\nGrey Box Testing: Combining both Black Box and White Box testing methods.\nBoundary Value Analysis (BVA): This technique is used to test the software's behaviour at its input and output boundaries. It involves testing the software with input values that are just above and just below the valid range, as well as testing the software with the maximum and minimum valid input values.\nEquivalence Class Partitioning (ECP): This technique is used to divide the input domain of the software into a finite number of classes or partitions, where each class represents a group of input values that are expected to behave in the same way. The goal of ECP is to test the software with a representative sample of input values from each partition.

In a login form, test the minimum and maximum length of the password field. For a form field that accepts a date, testing the software with a date that is just before and just after the valid range of dates. ECP: ECP: In a form field that accepts a phone number, divide the input domain into three classes: valid phone numbers, phone numbers that are too short, and phone numbers that are too long.\nIn a form field that accepts a price, divide the input domain into two classes: valid prices and invalid prices (e.g., negative prices). In a form field that accepts a phone number, divide the input domain into three classes: valid phone numbers, phone numbers that are too short, and phone numbers that are too long. In a form field that accepts a price, divide the input domain into two classes: valid prices and invalid prices (e.g., negative prices). It is important to note that these techniques are helpful in creating a comprehensive set of test cases that can help ensure that the software is functioning correctly. However, it's not enough to just use one technique, a combination of different techniques are used to test the software in different ways and identify all the possible defects.
