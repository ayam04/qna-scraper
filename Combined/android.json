For Example, suppose our current stack is A -> B -> C. Now, if we launch activity B again with the “standard” launch mode, then the new stack will be A -> B -> C -> B. SingleTop: SingleTop: This launch mode is similar to the Standard launch mode except if there exists an activity’s previous instance on the top of the stack, then a new instance will not be created.\nBut the intent will be sent to the activity’s existing instance.\nFor example, suppose our current stack is A -> B -> C. Now, if we launch the activity B again with “singleTop” launch mode,then the new stack will be A -> B -> C -> B.\nConsider another example, where the current stack is A -> B -> C. Now, if we launch activity C again with the “singleTop” launch mode, then the stack will remain the same i.e., A -> B -> C. The intent will be passed to the onNewIntent() method.

SingleTask: SingleTask: This launch mode will create a new task and push a new instance to the task as the root.\nFor example, suppose our current stack is A -> B -> C -> D. Now, if we launch activity B again with the “singleTask” launch mode, then the new stack will be A -> B. Here, a callback has been received on the old instance and C and D activities are destroyed.

If you want the OK and Cancel buttons to be below the rest of the form, next to one another, and flush to the right side of the screen, you will need a container. If you have several widgets, you will need a container to have a root element to place the widgets inside. Android provides a collection of view classes that serve as containers for views.

        "answer": "The JobSchedular API is used for scheduling different types of jobs against the framework that will be executed in your app’s own process. This allows your application to perform the given task while being considerate of the device’s battery at the cost of timing control. The JobScheduler supports batch scheduling of jobs. The Android system can combine jobs for reducing battery consumption. JobManager automatically handles the network unreliability so it makes handling uploads easier. Here is some example of a situation where you would use this job scheduler: Tasks that should be done when the device is connected to a power supply.\nTasks that require a Wi-Fi connection or network access.\nTasks should run on a regular basis as a batch where the timing is not critical. Tasks that should be done when the device is connected to a power supply. Tasks that require a Wi-Fi connection or network access.
