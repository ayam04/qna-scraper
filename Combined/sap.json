        "answer": "A pooled table is a special type of table that is present in the SAP ABAP(Advanced Business Application Programming) dictionary that is used to store control data. The pooled table is an SAP proprietary creation. It has a many-to-one relationship with tables within the SAP database. This implies that, for a provided pooled table in the database, the SAP data dictionary can have multiple smaller tables. SAP will make use of pooled tables to integrate and hold a huge number of small tables. This will help in reducing the space and resources required at the database level. SAP will mainly use pooled tables for system data maintenance. SAP ABAP Advanced Business Application Programming   The above-given figure shows how pooled tables are stored in the database backend. Here, the table pool will have TABNAME(Name of a pooled table), VARKEY(All primary key fields from pooled table record in string format), DATALN(String length in VARDATA), and VARDATA(All data fields from pooled table record in a string format).",

        "question": "17. What is BDC(Batch Data Communication)? How many methods of BDC are present?",
        "answer": "BDC(Batch Data Communication) is used for data transfer from the Non-SAP system to the SAP R/3 system. A huge amount of data can be added into the database of the sap tables instead of manual entry of the data. Use SHDB(transaction code used for transaction recording in SAP) transaction for recording and the cursor movement. This cursor movement is noticeable by the SAP software and according to our excel or flat file, the data will be sent or stored in the proper position. Batch Data Communication There are 3 methods you can use for transferring the data. The methods of BDC are: Batch Input Session Method: This method is mainly used in ABAP programming when no other method exists. The online transaction process is simulated and the data transfer will be done in the way it is done online. A batch input session will be created using SHDB that has all the data and screens and then processed. If you have made any changes to the screen then you need to add these screens to the program, otherwise, the BDC will be failed.\nDirect Input Method: In this method, the input file data will be transferred directly to the SAP database. The involvement of screens is not required. This method will make use of function modules to complete the task.\nCall Transaction Method: It does asynchronous processing of data and transfers only a small amount of data. Here, data will be automatically updated and it is having faster processing. If you are using this method, errors must be handled explicitly.

With the help of CMC(Central Management Console) or IDT(Information Design Tool), it is possible to create and save the OLAP connection. This OLAP connection can be created for connection with the Multi-provider, BI(Business Intelligence) server, InfoCube, and BEx query. If the connection is specific for a particular Cube, Query, or Multi-provider then the connection will be created in query or cube base. Otherwise, the connection will be created on the BI server using which connection to any BEx query is possible. The advantage of Connection creation on the BI server is only a single OLAP connection is required for all BO reports. Steps for creating OLAP connection to connect with BI server: Login to CMC with the right of Administrator authorization and go for the OLAP Connection option.\nThen select the option new connection.\nEnter the details of the BI server as given in the below screenshot.
