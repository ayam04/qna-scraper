        "question": "1. What should you do if you can't download a critical file because it's too large?",
        "answer": "The issue of a file being too large for a USB drive can be solved quite easily by changing the file system of the detachable drive from FAT32 to a more current system, such as exFAT or NTFS. Before you begin, examine the USB drive you're about to change for any vital files you own, and if it does, copy them to a separate location (such as the PC or a different removable drive). This is important since changing a drive's file system will wipe all of its contents. If you're unsure, go with exFAT: it has better support from non-Windows device manufacturers, so if you wish to use the USB drive with either a Mac or Linux computer, possibilities are they'll be able to open the contents without any additional adjusting. If you plan to use the drives with older Windows PCs, such as Windows XP, choose NFTS instead of exFAT because exFAT is a newer format that the older computer may not recognise.  ",

        "question": "3. What is BIOS?",
        "answer": "One of the most prevalent applications of Flash memory is for your computer's basic input/output system, sometimes known as the BIOS. When a computer is turned on, the BIOS allows it to do specific tasks right away. The BIOS' primary function is to control the early phases of a computer's starting process, guaranteeing that the operating system is loaded appropriately into memory. BIOS is vital to the functioning of most computers today, and understanding it can help you troubleshoot problems with your machine.   The Power On Self Test is the first thing the BIOS does once you turn on your computer. The BIOS examines the computer's hardware at the POST to ensure that it can complete the startup procedure. When a POST is successfully finished, the system normally emits a beep. However, if the attempt fails, the system usually produces a sequence of beeps. The quantity, duration, and pattern of such sounds can help you figure out why the test failed.\nAfter the POST, the BIOS tries to load the operating system using a program called a bootstrap loader, which is made to look for any available operating systems and load them into memory if one is discovered. At this stage, the BIOS drivers are also loaded. These are programs that allow the computer to control hardware devices simply.\nIn addition to computer security, the BIOS can play a role. The boot process can be password-protected in most BIOS software versions, which means you must provide a password before any BIOS action can take place. Because the BIOS performs nearly all of its duties during startup, the entire computer is effectively password-protected. Resetting a forgotten BIOS password, on the other hand, can be time-consuming and need access to some of the computer's highly sensitive components.\nThe BIOS software is usually stored on a Read-Only Memory (ROM) or a flash memory chip connected to the motherboard of your computer. Because the BIOS software is the first to take control of the system when you switch it on, the position of the BIOS program on the chip is critical. Your computer's CPU would just not know where to find the BIOS if it wasn't constantly in the same position on the same chip, and the boot process would fail.

        "question": "16. Define the Network Troubleshooting Procedure.",
        "answer": "The combined measurements and processes used to discover, diagnose, and address problems in a computer network are referred to as network troubleshooting. It's a logical procedure used by network engineers to address network issues and increase network performance. Before you begin troubleshooting any problem, you should have a clear grasp of what the issue is, how it arose, who it affects, and how long it has been present. You'll have a far higher chance of addressing the problem quickly if you acquire the proper facts and clarify the problem, rather than wasting time on useless fixes. To assist diagnose and fixing the issue, you can always start troubleshooting with these simple network troubleshooting procedures. Hardware Inspection: To begin, inspect the hardware that is installed on a computer, server, laptop, or other similar devices to ensure that it is connected, switched on, and operational. Sometimes the issue is as simple as a loose cord, a router that has shut down, or an unplugged cord; in these circumstances, network troubleshooting is unnecessary. Other basic methods for debugging network hardware can be followed.\nPerhaps turning the gadget on and off or leaving it off for sixty seconds will cure the problem. Cycling at a high intensity is also a good way to do so.\nIpconfig: Ipconfig can be used to display TCP/IP network configuration values, discard a device's current IP and DHCP settings, and refresh a device's DHCP settings. Type ipconfig into the terminal from the command prompt. You may get your default gateway and IP address, but if it starts with 169, it won't get a genuine IP address. In some circumstances, using \"ipconfig/renew\" to request a new one would solve the problem. If you acquire your IP address through an ethernet cable, the problem is with the router rather than the network.\nPing and Tracert: The \"ping\" command lets you send a signal to another device, which, if it is operational, will respond with a response to the sender. The \"ping\" command employs a \"echo request,\" which is a component of the ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol). When you ping a device, you're sending out an echo request, and you'll get an echo back if the device is active or online. Tracert command displays all of a packet's steps on its way to its destination.\nIf the IP address is correct without ethernet, the issue is most likely between your router and the internet. This is the moment to use ping to check if larger servers can connect to your router. If this is unable to connect to your router, there may be an issue. Tracert, which bounces between your router and server’s DNS, can also be used to track the problem. We can pinpoint the exact site of the issue, and if the error occurs early, the issue may be with your local network.\nDNS Check: Use nslookup command to see if the server you're using has any issues. The nslookup command retrieves DNS records for a domain name or an IP address. Remember that DNS servers contain IP addresses and domain names, therefore the nslookup command allows you to query DNS records for information. If you see terms like \"timed out,\" \"service failure,\" \"refused,\" or \"network is unreachable\" on your screen, the issue is with the DNS rather than your network. To find the precise IP address(es) associated with a domain name, use the nslookup command. There is a DNS problem if this utility is unable to resolve this information. Along with simple lookup, the nslookup tool can query specific DNS servers to discover if there is a problem with the host's default DNS servers.\nISP (Internet Service Provider) contact: Contact your internet service provider if you have any problems with your internet service. Perhaps there is a problem on their end. You can also use the mobile apps to see if other people are experiencing the same issues by looking up outage maps and associated information.\nMalware and Viruses Check: Malware and Viruses Check is done to see if something is preventing some programs from connecting to the network and running properly. This could be because your antivirus software isn't up to date, or the network is experiencing issues that are being blocked by it.\nDatabase logs: Checks for faults in your database and database connections if it isn't performing properly. Perhaps it is not working as it should, causing difficulties to spread and the network to slow down.

The \"ping\" command employs a \"echo request,\" which is a component of the ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol). When you ping a device, you're sending out an echo request, and you'll get an echo back if the device is active or online. Tracert command displays all of a packet's steps on its way to its destination.\nIf the IP address is correct without ethernet, the issue is most likely between your router and the internet. This is the moment to use ping to check if larger servers can connect to your router. If this is unable to connect to your router, there may be an issue. Tracert, which bounces between your router and server’s DNS, can also be used to track the problem. We can pinpoint the exact site of the issue, and if the error occurs early, the issue may be with your local network. Ping and Tracert:  DNS Check: Use nslookup command to see if the server you're using has any issues. The nslookup command retrieves DNS records for a domain name or an IP address. Remember that DNS servers contain IP addresses and domain names, therefore the nslookup command allows you to query DNS records for information. If you see terms like \"timed out,\" \"service failure,\" \"refused,\" or \"network is unreachable\" on your screen, the issue is with the DNS rather than your network. To find the precise IP address(es) associated with a domain name, use the nslookup command. There is a DNS problem if this utility is unable to resolve this information. Along with simple lookup, the nslookup tool can query specific DNS servers to discover if there is a problem with the host's default DNS servers. DNS Check: ISP (Internet Service Provider) contact: Contact your internet service provider if you have any problems with your internet service. Perhaps there is a problem on their end. You can also use the mobile apps to see if other people are experiencing the same issues by looking up outage maps and associated information. ISP (Internet Service Provider) contact: Malware and Viruses Check: Malware and Viruses Check is done to see if something is preventing some programs from connecting to the network and running properly. This could be because your antivirus software isn't up to date, or the network is experiencing issues that are being blocked by it. Malware and Viruses Check: Database logs: Checks for faults in your database and database connections if it isn't performing properly. Perhaps it is not working as it should, causing difficulties to spread and the network to slow down. Database logs:",

        "question": "1. A consumer claims that their Windows restarts at random intervals. What are your thoughts on this, and how would you solve the problem?",
        "answer": "If your Windows machine restarts without warning, consider the troubleshooting methods below for assistance in addressing the issue. Software issues: Microsoft intended Windows to automatically reboot when issues, such as a blue screen of death, occur since the release of Windows XP. Although this feature is useful for random failures, it makes troubleshooting and repair more complex. The procedures to disable and enable this function in Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10 are listed below. Software issues Right-click My Computer on the desktop. Open File Explorer in Windows 8 or 10 and right-click This PC in the left navigation pane.\nIn the pop-up menu, choose the Properties option.\nSelect the Advanced tab or the Advanced system settings link in the System Properties box.\nClick on The settings option under Startup and Recovery on the Advanced tab.\nDisable the Automatically restart check box in the Startup and Recovery window.\nClick the OK button. Right-click My Computer on the desktop. Open File Explorer in Windows 8 or 10 and right-click This PC in the left navigation pane. In the pop-up menu, choose the Properties option. Select the Advanced tab or the Advanced system settings link in the System Properties box. Click on The settings option under Startup and Recovery on the Advanced tab. Disable the Automatically restart check box in the Startup and Recovery window. Click the OK button. Hardware issues: If you've previously attempted to introduce a new hardware device, make sure it's not the source of your problems. By looking for problems in Device Manager, you can make sure you're not having any hardware conflicts. If you've just installed new hardware drivers, you might want to go back to an older version. If the unexpected reboots persist despite updating drivers and removing any newly attached hardware, the computer memory is bad. Finally, improperly installed hardware devices in the computer can result in random reboots. Ensure that all cables and expansion cards are correctly connected to the computer. Hardware issues Computer viruses: These viruses usually cause the computer to reset every 5, 10, 15, or 30 minutes after it has booted. If you suspect your computer is infected, make sure you have an antivirus program installed and that your virus scanner definitions are updated. Computer viruses: Overheating: Most computers today are intended to shut down or reboot automatically if the processor, video card, or other components become too hot. Examine the rear of the computer to see if the fan on the power supply is operating. A temperature gun can be used to determine how hot the computer's hardware devices or integrated circuits are. Overheating: Issues with the Operating System: If your computer continues to reboot after completing the steps above, you're most likely dealing with a problem with the Microsoft Windows operating system. When the computer starts to boot up, restart it and enter BIOS setup. Allow the machine to sit idle for several minutes after you've loaded the BIOS setup. Issues with the Operating System: If the system doesn't reboot after resting in BIOS and you've exhausted all of the above options, try enabling a restore point in Windows from before the problem began. If enabling a previous restore point fails, or if no restore points are available, you will most probably have to reinstall Microsoft Windows.

        "question": "2. Why is it important to test your computer’s RAM? How can you do it?",
        "answer": "The working memory of your computer is its random access memory (RAM). The operating system and programs on your computer are constantly writing and retrieving data from RAM. When you open a web page such as this one, for example, your web browser saves it in RAM as you read it. When you start a PC game, it loads data from a slower storage system (such as a hard disc or solid-state drive) into considerably faster RAM. If your computer's RAM is defective, you may experience issues. When your computer goes to read the RAM, it will consider various data than it saved to RAM. Software crashes, system freezing, blue screens of death (BSODs), file corruption, and other issues can result as a result of this. These programs work by writing data to every sector of your computer's RAM and then recovering it back in a sequential manner. If the utility returns a different result, it means your RAM is bad. The finest RAM testing software necessitates booting into a separate bootable system. This gets Windows (or some other operating system) out of the way and gives the tool complete access to your RAM at a low level. You can run tools from within Windows, such as HCI Design's MemTest, but they aren't as trustworthy. Launch the Windows Memory Diagnostics program. A RAM testing tool is included with Windows. It comes preinstalled on Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows 7, and all other recent Windows versions. Launch the Windows Memory Diagnostics program. A RAM testing tool is included with Windows. It comes preinstalled on Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows 7, and all other recent Windows versions.   You can install and use MemTest86 if you need a more capable testing tool. It runs a larger range of tests and may uncover issues that the Windows test would miss. If you want to try something else, MemTest86+ is a free and open-source program. Both of these programs are self-contained and bootable. You can copy a USB image from MemTest86 to a USB disc. To make a bootable USB drive, simply run the EXE file provided with the download as well as provide a spare USB drive.

        "question": "3. Explain differential backup vs incremental backup.",
        "answer": "The fundamental distinction between incremental and differential backups is that incremental backups save space and time by simply saving modified data. Incremental backups, on the other hand, are not as effective as differential backups. Let's discuss Full Backups before diving into the distinctions between Incremental and Differential backups. A full backup is the launching point in both incremental and differential backup schemes in their most basic form. Of course, a complete backup backs up all the information on a partition or disc by copying all data-containing disc sectors to the backup image file. An incremental backup is a copy of any data that has changed since the last backup. As a result, if you make a full backup of your system on Sunday, an incremental backup on Monday will only transfer and save data that has changed or been added since Sunday. On Tuesday, an incremental backup will only deal with data that has changed since Monday's incremental backup, and so on. The differential backup, unlike an incremental backup, only backs up data that has changed since the last full backup. The difference between incremental backup and differential backup is given in the table below: Particulars Incremental backup Differential backup\nDescription Backs up all data that has changed since the previous backup, such as since the last complete or incremental backup. All data that has changed since the last full backup is backed up.\nStorage space It demands less amount of storage space. This backup requires less storage than a full backup, but more than incremental backups.\nData recovery Data recovery might take a long time and be difficult. Data recovery takes less time.\nBackup Taking a  backup is quicker. This backup is faster than a full backup, but not as fast as an incremental backup.\nBandwith range It has a lower bandwidth range.

It uses less bandwidth than a full backup, but more than incremental recovery. Daily, a differential backup approach backs up files that have changed since the previous full backup. Because less data is stored up, they are much faster than complete backups. In contrast to differential backups, incremental backups copy files that have changed after the last backup of whatever type, which can be a complete or incremental backup. The fewer data that needs to be backed up when incremental backups are conducted, the shorter the time between backups. One of the advantages of differential backup over incremental backup is that you just need the most recent full backup and differential backup to recover data, which speeds up the process. However, until the next full backup, the amount of space needed by backed up data will increase with each differential backup. Among the three strategies: full, differential, and incremental, incremental is the one that saves the most space. Even though the incremental backups offer more versatility and granularity (duration between backups), they have a tradition of taking longer to restore because they should be built from the most recent full backup and all successive incremental backups.",

        "question": "4. What does the term \"disc error\" mean, and how would you respond if you received this message?",
        "answer": "When the computer BIOS cannot detect a bootable operating system on any of the storage devices included in the notebook computer's boot path, the Non-System Disk Error or Disk Error message appears. Here are a few approaches that may be useful, and any of them may be the answer to your problem. Method 1: Examine all non-bootable storage media. Method 1: Examine all non-bootable storage media. First and foremost, make a list of all non-bootable storage devices connected to the computer and remove or detach them. When you connect many devices to a computer, the system may have trouble determining which device has the OS loaded, which can result in an error like this. As a result, disconnect all non-bootable external devices. Method 2: Check the IDE ( Integrated Drive Electronics ) or SATA ( Serial Advanced Technology Attachment )cable on the HDD. Method 2: Check the IDE ( Integrated Drive Electronics ) or SATA ( Serial Advanced Technology Attachment )cable on the HDD. If your hard disk's IDE or SATA cable is damaged or improperly attached, the system may be unable to read the disc, resulting in the \"non-system disc error.\" If the cable is damaged or malfunctioning, simply reconnect it properly or purchase a new one. If the HDD cable is in good shape and securely attached, but the error remains, it's possible that the HDD on which Windows was installed is not set as the primary disc in BIOS.

Gather facts about network and network problems: To provide the greatest help to your end consumers, you must first determine what the issue is. Collect enough information from the people who are having network problems as well as the network itself to be able to duplicate or diagnose the problem. Take cautious not to confuse symptoms with the core cause, as what appears to be a problem may be a symptom of a greater problem.\nLogs can be customised: Make sure your event and security logs are set up to provide you with the information you need to troubleshoot and analyse the root cause. Each log should provide a clear explanation of the items or events being tracked, as well as the date and time, as well as information about the report's source (MAC or IP address).\nExamine security and access: Check that no access or security concerns have arisen by ensuring that all access permissions are as they should be and that no one has tampered with a sensitive section of the network they weren't meant to. Check that any firewalls, antivirus, and malware software are up to date and that no security concerns are interfering with your users' ability to operate.\nAdhere to an escalation protocol: There's nothing more irritating than going to the IT help desk and getting routed to someone else, who then directs you to someone else, who then refers you to someone else, and so on. Establish a clear escalation system that identifies who is responsible for certain concerns, as well as the last person in the chain who can be contacted for assistance.

        "question": "9. Under what circumstances can you not convert a basic disc to a dynamic disc?",
        "answer": "Dynamic discs are logical discs that can use several hard drives in the computer to provide disc redundancy, mirroring, and improved performance and reliability. Dynamic discs are a type of volume management that permits volumes on one or more physical discs to have noncontiguous extents. It is not possible to transform every standard hard disc into a dynamic disc. Removable media, such as ZIP and Jaz discs, for example, cannot be transformed into dynamic discs. The explanation for this is straightforward. A dynamic disc is a storage device that can span many drives. The volume would be broken if it spanned a detachable disc and the disc was eliminated from the system. If the basic disc is on a laptop computer, it cannot be turned into a dynamic disc. This can be due to a variety of factors. You ought not to be running Windows Server 2003 on a laptop in the first place. Second, the majority of laptops have only one hard drive. Dynamic discs would provide no benefit to a system with a single hard drive. Third, when a laptop has multiple hard drives, one of them is frequently located in a docking station. A dynamic disc volume that encompassed the device's internal hard drive, as well as the docking station's hard drive would indeed be damaged if you removed your laptop from the docking station. Clustered servers are the third case in which a basic disc cannot be transformed into a dynamic disc. The final criteria about basic drives that cannot be transformed are that any hard disc with a sector size bigger than 512 bytes can't be converted (albeit this is unlikely). Cluster sizes larger than 512 bytes are possible, but not sectors.",

        "question": "12. How would you resolve DNS issues?",
        "answer": "Following are some ways to resolve DNS issues: Check your cords and connections: If you're using wired connections, double-check that everything is correctly plugged in. If you're using a wireless network, ensure sure it's turned on and connected. Check to see if your router is turned on and working.\nRule out ISP problems: Make sure you're not having problems with your Internet service provider by attempting to link with another device. If you can directly connect to your ISP without going through the router, do so.\nReboot your router: Turn it back on after a minute and wait till the indicator lights cease blinking before attempting to connect.\nScan for malware: In some situations, a virus could be preventing you from accessing the internet. In this instance, you may have more pressing concerns to address before addressing IP connectivity.\nExamine your TCP/IP settings: These options control how your computer interacts with others. You could have recently updated these settings and attempted to manually enter them. Find \"Manage network connections\" in your computer's networking or control panel. Locate and tap on both IPv6 and IPv4 \"Properties\" under \"Local Area Connections,\" \"Properties.\" Make sure \"Obtain an IP address automatically\" and \"Obtain DNS servers address automatically\" are both checked.\nClean out your DNS cache: Your computer's DNS cache is where it saves networking information from previous visits and efforts to connect to online sites. The cache can get corrupted as a result of incorrect data. Type ipconfig /flushdns into the command prompt to flush, or clear, this cache. The DNS cache will now have to update the DNS information the next time you visit a website.\nObtain a new domain name: Is your website address functional but taking you to an unfamiliar site? It's most possible that you neglected to renew the domain name.\nIf necessary, update and reinstall the network adapter driver: When was the last time you updated your drivers? This may be causing problems, especially if you've upgraded your PC's hardware since purchasing it. You can fix DNS problems by manually searching for network device driver updates and updating them.\nSwitch to Google's public DNS servers: Google's servers are usually more dependable and may be utilised without going via your ISP. You can change your DNS servers to Google's by altering the following properties in your Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4). Check your cords and connections: If you're using wired connections, double-check that everything is correctly plugged in.

        "question": "13. An ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) router connects a PC to the internet. The DNS server IP address is specified on the ADSL router. Is it necessary to configure the DNS server IP address on the computer to access the internet?",
        "answer": "It is necessary to configure the DNS server IP address on the machine. Take the case of a person who wants to visit a website. When a user starts a browser and types the website's URL name, a DNS resolution is required, in which the URL name is submitted to a DNS server. The PC must start the DNS request, which necessitates the configuration of the DNS server IP address on the PC. The DNS request will fail if the PC does not recognise the DNS server IP address, and internet access will be lost.",

        "question": "14. An organisation's administrator is unable to telnet to a router that is located 10 hops away from the admin PC. What tool can be used to locate the point where the connection is lost? Explain more about the command.",
        "answer": "The admin can use the traceroute command-line tool to inspect the location where packets are being dropped on the router. Traceroute is a command-line tool used in real-time network troubleshooting to determine the path data packets traverse across the internet to their destination addresses. When you visit a website, the traffic must pass through multiple intermediaries before it reaches the website. The traffic passes through your local router, the routers of your Internet service provider, and onto larger networks, among other things. Traceroute shows us the path that visitors take to get to the website. It also shows the length of time that each halt takes. If you're experiencing trouble accessing a website that appears to be operational, there could be a problem somewhere along the path between your computer and the website's servers. Traceroute would reveal the source of the issue. In more technical terms, traceroute uses the ICMP protocol to deliver a series of packets (the same protocol used for the ping command.) The time-to-live (also known as TTL, or hop limit) of the first packet is 1, the second packet is 2, and so on. The TTL is reduced by one each time a packet is forwarded to a new router. The packet is deleted when it reaches 0 and the router delivers an error message. Traceroute ensures that each router in the path discards a packet and responds by forwarding packets in this manner.",

        "question": "15. How would you fix the ‘No Signal Input’ error on your screen?",
        "answer": "The most common fixes for the the ‘No Signal Input’ error on your screen are:   Power and Cabling Issues: This may seem self-evident, but the solution could be as simple as double-checking all electrical connections and ensuring the input device is turned on. Make sure your video monitor cable or HDMI cable is securely attached to the PC or other input device as well as the display. If you're using a desktop tower computer, ensure it's turned on. Some PCs feature cooling fans that spin and create noise even when the computer is not turned on. Check that the power light is on and that the monitor and computer are both connected to a power supply. If you ever discover that your monitor isn't turning on properly, this is a superb method to employ. Examine the state of your power cord. This display problem can be caused by a faulty power cord or power strip. When working with a frayed or damaged power cord, use caution.\nSource of Input is Incorrect: Make sure the correct input source is selected if your monitor has multiple input channels. If you're using a video output or HDMI cable to connect to a PC, make sure the monitor input is set to the correct source, such as HDMI or Video. You can normally accomplish this by pushing the menu button until you find the input button on the monitor's main menu or control panel, then selecting the input button to cycle through the settings until you obtain the correct video signal.\nSetting the Monitor Resolution: If the monitor display resolutions are out of sync with the input signal, some external display monitors will display no image and an error message. The monitor may display a \"no input signal\" message if your PC video card or graphics card is set to a display resolution higher than the monitor's native display resolution. To find out what your monitor's maximum and native resolutions are, look at its specifications. If you're not sure and have a Windows PC, consider starting it in safe mode, which has a lower display resolution.\nProblems with Graphics Cards: If you're using a graphics card that can be swapped out, check sure it's firmly seated in its slot. Before removing an internal graphics card, make sure all cables are disconnected and the device is turned off. A display device may produce an error message due to a faulty video card or an incompatible video card driver. When a computer is turned on, never remove the cover.\nExperiment using a different cable or a computer: A damaged video cable is also likely to be the source of the monitor's lack of signal. If the problem persists, try connecting your monitor and PC with a fresh cable. If not, the problem is due to a problem with your video cable. If the problem persists, try connecting your monitor to a different computer. If your monitor still displays the no signal message, it's possible that the monitor is the source of the problem.
