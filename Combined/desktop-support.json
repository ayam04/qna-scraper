        "answer": "Desktop support engineers are typically IT experts who resolve issues related to Information Technology (IT) within an organization or for individuals. Also, they are able to aid with the setting up and maintenance of laptops and the resolution of security and server issues that affect businesses. It is their job to assist companies or individuals in installing, patching, upgrading, and troubleshooting software and fixing any security issues with these machines, and even assisting with issues related to servers or racks.",

        "answer": "A bus is a simple circuit that is used to connect one part of the motherboard to another by means of an electrical path. When a bus can handle more data at once, it will transfer data more quickly between computer components. \"Bus speed\" refers to the rate at which data can be transferred from one computer component to another. The speed of the bus can be expressed in megahertz (MHz), which indicates how much data can be transported across the bus at one time.",

Domain names such as scaler.com and interviewbit.com are used by humans to access information online. A web browser interacts with the Internet using IP addresses. DNS transforms domain names into IP addresses for browsers to access Internet resources. Every connected device to the internet has an IP address that can be used by other machines to find that device. With DNS servers, humans no longer need to memorize IP addresses like 172.158.1.16 (in IPv4), or complex addresses like 2550:ab00:2628:1::c629:d5a6 (in IPv6).",

Each zone serves a different purpose. Forward lookup zone: This zone maps hostnames to IP addresses. Whenever a computer requests an IP address by providing the hostname, the forward look-up zone is queried to obtain the IP address for that hostname. For example, if you type www.scaler.com into the address bar of your browser, the forward zone is queried and it will return the IP address 137.336.245.17, which is actually the IP address of the site you are looking at.\nReverse lookup zone: This zone maps an IP address to the hostname.

Step 3: BOOT Step 4: Boot your computer again and check whether you still receive the NTLDR is missing error. Step 4: Upgrade your outdated BIOS: You may occasionally encounter the NTLDR missing issue if the basic input/output system (BIOS) on your computer is outdated. Accordingly, it is imperative that you install the most recent version of BIOS on your computer. It is best to contact the computer manufacturer to see how to obtain and install the latest BIOS update. Upgrade your outdated BIOS:",

        "question": "4. State difference between Incremental and Differential Backup.",
        "answer": "Incremental and Differential backups are two different backup strategies with the same purpose i.e., to optimize the backup space as well as the backup time. Incremental Backup Differential Backup\nAn incremental backup preserves all changes made since the previous full or incremental backup. It does not copy previously backed up files, only newly altered or created ones. Different backup strategies backup only the files that have changed since the last full backup. \nIn this type of backup, recovery is difficult. Recovery is easier with differential backups.\nIt reduces bandwidth utilization, reduces storage space requirements, and provides faster backups. This type of backup uses less storage space than full backups, but more than incremental backups. \nExample: Consider doing a full backup on Sunday.\nSunday: A full backup of the data.\nMonday: On Monday, incremental backup copies just Monday's changes without copying Sunday's backup.\nTuesday: On Tuesday, the backup only retains the changes/additions made on Tuesday. This is also true for Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.\nExample: Consider doing a full backup on Sunday.\nSunday: A full backup of the data.\nMonday: This backs up Monday's data.\nTuesday: The backup includes Monday's and Tuesday's data.\nWednesday: The backup comprises Monday's, Tuesday's, and Wednesday's data, and so on.
