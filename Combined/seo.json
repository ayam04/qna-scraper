It enables internet users to search the information via the World Wide Web (WWW). The user is required to enter keywords or phrases into the search engines and then search engine searches websites, web pages or documents containing the similar keywords and presents a list of web pages with same keywords in the search engine result pages.\nWe can say that it generally answers the queries entered by the users in the form of a list of search results. So, it is a web-based tool that enables us to find information on the World Wide Web. Some of the popular search engines are Google, Bing, and Yahoo.",

        "question": "11) How does a search engine work?",
        "answer": "To understand, how a search engine works, we can divide the work of search engines into three different stages: crawling, indexing, and retrieval.\nCrawling: It is performed by software robots called web spiders or web crawlers. Each search engine has its web spiders to perform crawling. In this step, the spiders visit websites or web pages and read them and follow the links to other web pages of the site. Thus by crawling, they can find out what is published on the World Wide Web. Once the crawler visits a page, it makes a copy of that page and adds its URL to the index.\n\nThe web spider generally starts crawling with heavily used servers and popular web pages. It follows the route determined by the link structure and finds new interconnected documents through new links. It also revisits the previous sites to check for the changes or updates in the web pages. If changes are found, it makes a copy of the changes to update the index.\nIndexing: It involves building an index after crawling all websites or web pages found on the World Wide Web. An index of the crawled sites is made based on the type and quality of information provided by them and stored in huge storage facilities. It is like a book that contains a copy of each webpage crawled by the spider. Thus, it collects and organizes the information from all over the internet.\n\n\nRetrieval: In this step, the search engine responds to the search queries made by the users by providing a list of websites with relevant answers or information in a particular order. It keeps the relevant websites, which offer unique and original information, on the top of the search engine result pages. So, whenever, a user performs an online search, the search engine searches its database for the websites or web pages with relevant information and make a list of these sites based on their relevancy and present this list to the users on the search engine result pages.",

It enhances the user experience as it takes the users directly to a specific area of a webpage. They are not required to scroll down the information to find a particular section. So, it is a way to improve navigation.\nIt also enables webmasters to keep things in order as there is no need of creating different web pages or splitting up a document. Google also sends users to a specific part of your page using this tag. You can attach anchor tag to a word or a phrase. It takes the reader down to a different section of the page instead of another page. When you use this tag, you create a unique URL on the same page.",

Keywords should be 2 to 4 % of the total world count, increasing keyword density beyond this is known as black hat SEO as it is against the SEO guidelines of Google.\nCloaking: In this technique, the web pages are coded are in such a way that visitors see different content in a webpage and search engines see different content on the same webpage. Increasing ranking in this way is also against the guidelines of search engine.\nDoorway pages: These pages are rich in keywords and do not have quality content and relevant information. They redirect users to a different page to increase the ranking of that page. It is also against the guidelines of Google.\nHidden Text: It is the text that can be viewed by the search engine, but visitors cannot view. It is used to include irrelevant keywords and hide text or links to increase the keyword density and improve the internal link structure.\nArticle Spinning: It refers to rewriting an article multiple times to produce its different copies in such a way that each copy looks different from other copies and is treated as a new article.\nDuplicate Content: It is the content that is copied from one site and uploaded to another site.

For example: <meta name=\"description\" content = \"your site's summary\"/>\nKeywords Meta tag: In this tag, you place all of your main keywords and phrases that describe the content of your webpage.

When the crawler visits a page, it makes a copy of that page and adds its URL to the index which is called indexing. The search engines have software robots, which are known as web spiders or web crawlers, for crawling.\n\nThe crawler not only reads the pages but also follows the internal and external links. Thus, they can find out what is published on the World Wide Web. The crawlers also revisit the previous sites to check for the changes or updates in their web pages. If changes are found, it updates the index accordingly.",

An index is a place where all the data that has been crawled is stored, i.e., it is like a huge book with a copy of each page that is crawled. Whenever users enter search queries, it is the index that provides the results for search queries within seconds. Without an index, it won't be possible for a search engine to render search results so fast.\n\nSo, the index is made of URLs of different web pages visited by the crawler. The information contained in the web pages is provided by the search engines to users for their queries. If a page is not added to the index, it can't be viewed by the users.",
