They are as follows: Stealth Rule: Stealth is the first recommended rule to include in your rule base. Using this rule, we can prevent direct access to the Security Gateway, thereby providing protection against attacks. Normally, the stealth rule should be placed near the top of the rule base, with only rules that allow or require access to the firewall above it.\nCleanup Rule: Cleanup rules are placed at the end of the security Rulebase. Furthermore, Check Point suggests adding a cleanup rule, which drops and logs every packet that isn't matched by other rules. Logging dropped packets is extremely useful for security and troubleshooting. Stealth Rule: Stealth is the first recommended rule to include in your rule base.

        "question": "8. Explain NAT (Network Address Translation).",
        "answer": "NAT refers to network address translation.  NAT (Network Address Translation) is Firewall Software Blade's feature and ensures greater security by replacing/translating IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. NAT hides internal IP addresses from the Internet in order to protect the identity of a network. A firewall can alter both the source and destination IP addresses of a packet. The firewall, for example, translates the source IP address (to a new one) of packets that go from an internal computer to an external computer. Firewalls translate the new IP addresses back to the original IP addresses as packets return from the external computer. When packets return from the external computer, they are routed to the correct internal computer. Example: Suppose a network has 1,000 computers but one internet connection. What makes it possible that 1000 devices can access one internet connection, right? This is made possible by NAT. A private IP address is assigned to each of the 1000 computers, i.e., (10.0._._), and they are all connected to the router. It is connected directly to the internet and has NAT settings configured. Example:   When PC 1 (which has an IP address of 10.0.0.1) attempts to access the internet (www.google.com), it will first send a request to the router, and the router converts the private IP address into a public IP address (10.0.0.1 - 12.0.0.1) and forwards the request to the Google web server. This information is, however, saved in the NAT forwarding table by the router before forwarding this request. So, when the response comes from the web server, the router can convert the public IP back to the private IP (12.0.0.1 - 10.0.0.1), and deliver the information back to the requested PC.",

DMZ networks contain the organization's public-facing services and are designed to protect the internal network. A DMZ should contain any services that can be accessed by users connecting from an external network. The most common services are Web servers, mail servers, and FTP (File Transfer Protocol) servers.   For both individuals and large organizations, DMZs are crucial to network security.

The public key, as its name implies, can be exchanged securely with communication partners, while the private key must remain confidential (secret). The private key is typically used to decrypt data, while the public key is used to encrypt data.   To encrypt traffic between Jessica and Monica, as depicted in the above figure, the pair will exchange public keys. In order to encrypt Jessica' message to Monica, Jessica will use Monica's public key. Monica will need to use his own private key to decrypt Jessica' message.\nWhen Monica replies to Jessica in the future, the same process will play out. Monica will use Jessica's public key to encrypt his reply message to Jessica.  Jessica will need to use his own private key to decrypt Monica's reply message.

By using Anti-Spoofing, we can determine if a packet with an IP address concealed behind a certain interface is actually arriving from a different interface. A packet from an external network with an internal IP address, for example, would automatically be blocked by Anti-Spoofing. It ensures that packets are going to and coming from the correct interfaces on the security gateway. Example: Example: In the following diagram, a Security Gateway is shown with interfaces 2, 3, and 4, as well as some example networks.   When Anti-Spoofing is enabled on the Security Gateway, it ensures that: All incoming packets coming to interface 2 should be from the Internet (1)\nAll incoming packets coming to interface 3 should be from 192.168.33.0\nAll incoming packets coming to interface 4 should be from 192.0.2.0 or 10.10.10.0 All incoming packets coming to interface 2 should be from the Internet (1) All incoming packets coming to interface 3 should be from 192.168.33.0 All incoming packets coming to interface 4 should be from 192.0.2.0 or 10.10.10.0 Packets with source IP addresses in network 192.168.33.0 that arrive at interface 2 or 4 are blocked since the source address has been spoofed.",

It is a cybercrime where someone impersonates a trusted contact or organization, pretending to be someone you trust, and tries to access your sensitive personal information. Any time an online scammer or fraudster disguises their identity as something else, it's spoofing. In this cybercrime, the attackers copy and exploit the identity of your contacts and disguise them as well-known brands or some trusted websites and networks.\nIn the spoofing attack, the attackers change the source address of an incoming packet and make it appear as if it is coming from a known, trusted source.\nA good example of spoofing is phone spoofing. In this type of spoofing, a caller on the other end falsely introduces himself as a representative or an official bank authority and asks for your account details or debit or credit card information. Another example of spoofing is IP address spoofing, where hackers create Internet Protocol (IP) packets with a false source IP address to impersonate another computing system.",

        "question": "27) What do you understand by a Network Firewall?",
        "answer": "A Network Firewall is a system or set used to implement an access control policy between two networks. A firewall has a pair of mechanisms:\nThe first mechanism of a firewall is that it blocks the traffic.\nThe second one is that it permits traffic.\nIt means that some firewalls are used to block the traffic, and some firewalls aim to permit traffic. In a firewall, the most important thing is the implementation of access control policies. A user must clearly understand what type of access they want to allow or deny.",

        "question": "28) What is Bastion Host?",
        "answer": "A Bastion Host is a dedicated system intentionally exposed on a public network. From a secured network point-of-view, as it is the only node exposed to the outside world intentionally on a public network, it is very vulnerable to attack. This dedicated system is placed outside the Firewall in one firewall system, or if the system has two firewalls, it is placed between two firewalls.\nBastion Host filters and processes incoming traffic and diverts vulnerable traffic from entering the network, serving as a gateway. Some common examples for bastion hosts are domain name systems and mail.",

It is used to provide only light filtering.\nComputer-based Firewall: This type of Firewall is stored in a server with an existing Operating System like Windows and UNIX.\nHardware base Firewall: As the name indicates, this type of Firewall has a device-like box that allows strong security from public networks. Big networks mostly use this type of Firewall.\nProxy Server: It also acts as a type of Firewall that allows all clients to access the Internet with different access limits. The proxy server has its Firewall, which filters all packets from the web server.",

Besides this, some other ScreenOS features like deep inspection, in which the gateway checks traffic at the application layer.\nThe application-level gateway is mainly used to support the applications, which use the application layer payload for interacting with the dynamic Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) on which applications open data connections.",
