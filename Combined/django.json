    {
        "question": "3. What is the difference between a project and an app in Django?",
        "answer": "In Django, a project is the entire application and an app is a module inside the project that deals with one specific requirement. E.g., if the entire project is an ecommerce site, then inside the project we will have several apps, such as the retail site app, the buyer site app, the shipment site app, etc.",

        "question": "4. What is Django Admin Interface?",
        "answer": "Django comes with a fully customizable in-built admin interface, which lets us see and make changes to all the data in the database of registered apps and models. To use a database table with the admin interface, we need to register the model in the admin.py file.",

    {
        "question": "5. Explain Django’s Request/Response Cycle.",
        "answer": "In the Request/Response Cycle, first, a request is received by the Django server. Then, the server looks for a matching URL in the urlpatterns defined for the project. If no matching URL is found, then a response with 404 status code is returned. If a URL matches, then the corresponding code in the view file associated with the URL is executed to build and send a response.\nCheck out this video on Django Interview Questions:",

        "question": "6. What is a model in Django?",
        "answer": "A model is a Python class in Django that is derived from the django.db.models.Model class. A model is used in Django to represent a table in a database. It is used to interact with and get results from the database tables of our application.",

    },
    {
        "question": "7. What are migrations in Django?",
        "answer": "A migration in Django is a Python file that contains changes we make to our models so that they can be converted into a database schema in our DBMS. So, instead of manually making changes to our database schema by writing queries in our DBMS shell, we can just make changes to our models. Then, we can use Django to generate migrations from those model changes and run those migrations to make changes to our database schema.",

    {
        "question": "8. What are views in Django?",
        "answer": "A view in Django is a class and/or a function that receives a request and returns a response. A view is usually associated with urlpatterns, and the logic encapsulated in a view is run when a request to the URL associated with it is run. A view, among other things, gets data from the database using models, passes that data to the templates, and sends back the rendered template to the user as an HttpResponse.",

    },
    {
        "question": "9. What is the use of the include function in the urls.py file in Django?",
        "answer": "As in Django there can be many apps, each app may have some URLs that it responds to. Rather than registering all URLs for all apps in a single urls.py file, each app maintains its own urls.py file, and in the project’s urls.py file we use each individual urls.py file of each app by using the include function.",

        "question": "10. Why is Django called a loosely coupled framework?",
        "answer": "Django is called a loosely coupled framework because of its MVT architecture, which is a variant of the MVC architecture. It helps in separating the server code from the client-related code. Django’s models and views take care of the code that needs to be run on the server like getting records from database, etc., and the templates are mostly HTML and CSS that just need data from models passed in by the views to render them. Since these components are independent of each other, Django is called a loosely coupled framework.\n\nIntermediate Django Interview Questions\n\nGet 100% Hike!\nMaster Most in Demand Skills Now !\nBy providing your contact details, you agree to our Terms of Use & Privacy Policy",

        "answer": "ORM stands for Object-relational Mapper. Instead of interacting with the database by writing raw SQL queries and converting the data returned from the query into a Python object, ORM allows us to interact with the database using objects of our model class. So, we just interact with our models and ORM converts these changes into SQL queries based on the database we are using, e.g., SQLite.",

        "question": "12. How do templates work in Django?",
        "answer": "In Django, templates are used to dynamically generate web content. Django’s templating engine handles templating that involves parsing, processing, and converting the template into an HttpResponse to return back to the client. These templates are by default written in Django Templating Language (DTL), which allows us to output the dynamic content in the templates based on the data passed in by the view.",

        "question": "13. How do we register a model with Django admin?",
        "answer": "To register a model with Django’s admin interface, we make changes to our apps admin.py file. We have to open the admin.py file in the app folder in which our models are. For example, if we have an app named ‘polls’ and we wish to register a model named ‘Question’, then we need to open ‘polls/admin.py’ and import the Question model and write: admin.site.register(Question).

        "question": "16. What is Sessions Framework in Django?",
        "answer": "The Sessions framework in Django is used to store arbitrary information about the user on the server in the database. This is done because HTTP is a stateless protocol, i.e., it does not store information between subsequent requests. Django uses a cookie containing a special session ID to identify each browser and its associated session with the site.",

To solve this issue, Django uses class-based generic views.

Render function is a shortcut function that lets the developer easily pass the data dictionary with the template. This function then combines the template with a data dictionary via templating engine. Finally, this render() returns as HttpResponse with the rendered text, which is the data returned by models. Thus, Django render() bypasses most of the developer’s work and lets him use different template engines.\nThe basic syntax:\nrender(request, template_name, context=None, content_type=None, status=None, using=None)\nThe request is the parameter that generates the response. The template name is the HTML template used, whereas the context is a dict of the data passed on the page from the python. You can also specify the content type, the status of the data you passed, and the render you are returning.   render(request, template_name, context=None, content_type=None, status=None, using=None) ",

        "question": "7) How does Django work?",
        "answer": "Django can be broken into many components:\nModels.py file: This file defines your data model by extending your single line of code into full database tables and add a pre-built administration section to manage content.\nUrls.py file: It uses a regular expression to capture URL patterns for processing.\nViews.py file: It is the main part of Django. The actual processing happens in view.\nWhen a visitor lands on Django page, first Django checks the URLs pattern you have created and used the information to retrieve the view. After that view processes the request, querying your database if necessary, and passes the requested information to a template.\nAfter that, the template renders the data in a layout you have created and displayed the page.",
