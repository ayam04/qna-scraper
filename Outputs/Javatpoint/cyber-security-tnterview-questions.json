        "question": "4) What is the main goal of Cyber Security?",
        "answer": "The main objective of cyber security is to protect data from cyber-attacks. It follows a principle called CIA trio. It is a security sector that provides a triangle of three connected principles. The CIA model is used to help organizations to develop policies for their information security architecture. There are three main components Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of this CIA model. One or more of these principles is broken when it finds a security breach. This model provides a security paradigm to guide individuals through many aspects of IT security.\n\nLet's see these three security aspects in detail:\nConfidentiality: Confidentiality is used to provide privacy to prevent unauthorized access to data. It ensures that the data is only accessible to those who are authorized to use it and restricts access to others. It restricts vital information to be exposed to the wrong hands. A good example of Confidentiality is Data encryption which is used to keep information private.\nIntegrity: The Integrity principle is used to assure that the data is genuine, correct, and safe from unwanted threat actors or unintentional user alteration. It also specifies that the source of information must be genuine. If any changes are made, precautions should be taken to protect sensitive data from corruption or loss and recover from such an incident quickly.\nAvailability: The Availability principle ensures that the information is constantly available and accessible to those who have access to it. It also ensures that any types of system failures or cyber-attacks do not obstruct these accesses.",

        "answer": "Generally, people think that threat, vulnerability and risk are the same, but there are some crucial differences between them:\nThreat: A threat can be any form of hazard capable of destroying or stealing data, disrupting operations, or cause harm in general. Some examples of threats are Malware, phishing, data breaches, and even unethical employees etc. Any type of threat may be harmful for the organization, so; it is essential to understand threats for developing effective mitigation and making informed cyber security decisions.\nVulnerability: Vulnerability is a possible problem or a flaw in hardware, software, personnel, or procedures that can harm the organization. Threat actors can use these vulnerabilities to achieve their objectives.\nSome examples of vulnerabilities are given below:\nPhysical vulnerabilities: Publicly exposed networking equipment is an example of Physical vulnerability.\nSoftware vulnerabilities:e. buffer overflow vulnerability in a browser.\nHuman vulnerabilities:e. an employee vulnerable to phishing assaults.\nZero-day vulnerability: It is a type of vulnerability for which a remedy is not yet available.\nTo cope up with vulnerabilities, we have a method called Vulnerability management. It is the process of identifying, reporting and repairing vulnerabilities.\nRisk: Risk is a combination of threat and vulnerability. When we combine the probability of a threat and the consequence of vulnerability, it is called a risk. Risk is the likelihood of a threat agent successfully exploiting vulnerability.\nA formula to calculate risk:\nRisk = likelihood of a threat * Vulnerability Impact  \n\nTo control and manage the risk, we use a method called Risk management. It is a process of identifying all potential hazards, analyzing their impact, and determining the best course of action. This is an always running procedure used to examine the new threats and vulnerabilities regularly. By using this method, we can avoid or minimize risks. We can also accept or passed them to a third party according to the response chosen.",

Brute Force Attacks are automated in most cases where the tool/software automatically tries to log in with a list of possible credentials.\nFollowing is a list of some ways to prevent Brute Force Attacks:\nPassword Length: The length of a password is an important aspect to make it hard to crack. You can specify to set at least a minimum length for the password. The lengthier the password, the harder it is to find.\nPassword Complexity: You can include different characters formats in the password to make brute force attacks harder. Using the combination of alpha-numeric keywords along with special characters and upper and lower case characters can increase the password complexity making it difficult to be cracked.\nLimiting Login Attempts: You can make the password hard for brute force attacks by setting a limit on login failures. For example, you can set the limit on login failures as 5. So, when there are five consecutive login failures, the system will restrict the user from logging in for some time or send an Email or OTP to log in the next time.
