        "question": "14) What are the different types of communication models used in IoT?",
        "answer": "IoT devices must be connected to the internet to work properly. These devices connect and communicate through their technical communication models. There are several ways to connect them to the internet for communication. An effective communication model is required for proper communication. Following is a list of different types of communication models used in IoT:\nRequest-Response Communication Model\n\nAs the name specifies, the request-response communication model is based on the client making requests and the server responding to those requests. When the server receives a request, it decides what response to be provided. It fetches the requested data, prepares the response, and then sends it back to the client. This model does not retain the data between requests; therefore, each request is handled independently. That's why this is called a stateless model.\nPublisher-Subscriber Communication Model\n\nIn this communication model, publishers, brokers, and consumers are all involved in communication. Publishes are used as sources of data that send data to topics. The broker manages the topics, and consumers subscribe to the topics. Publishers and consumers are not directly related to each other. When the publisher receives the data for a topic, the broker forwards it to all subscribed consumers. It means brokers are responsible for receiving data from publishers and sending it to the appropriate consumers.\nPush-Pull Communication Model\n\nThe push-pull communication model ensures that data producers push the data into queues while consumers pull the data from the queues. In this communication model, neither producer nor consumer knows about each other, and it is the responsibility of the queue to decouple the messages between the consumers and the producers. Here, queues also act as a buffer if any mismatch is found between the rate at which producers push data and the rate at which consumers receive it.\nExclusive-Pair Model\n\nThis is the most efficient model for quick communication. This is a full-duplex, bidirectional communication model developed for constant/continuous connections between a client and server. Once a connection is established, the clients and the servers can send and receive messages. As long as a client doesn't send a request to close the connection, the connection remains open. The server takes care of every open connection.",
