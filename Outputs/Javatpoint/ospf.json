        "answer": "The OSPF Router ID is a 32-bit number similar to a normal IP address. It is elected as the highest IP Address of Loopback interfaces or the Highest IP of the active physical interfaces if loopback is not present. We can set it manually, but when the OSPF process is reset completely, or the device is reloaded, it will take effect. To avoid database issues, we should run only one router-id per device.",

        "answer": "In OSPF, the full form of LSA is Link State Advertisement. It is used in the Link State database for sharing the basic routing topology information to the other local routers. OSPF fills the Link State database with the LSA information. These LSAs are exchanged between routers until all of them have the same database of topology data.\nLSA = Link State Advertisement\nLSU = Link State Update\nLSR = Link State Request\nWhen two neighbors try to exchange routes, they have to send each other a list of all LSAs in their respective topology databases. Then each Router checks its topology database and sends an LSR message requesting all LSAs that were not found in its topology table. Other Router responds with the LSU that contains all LSAs requested by the neighbor.",

The Hello packets either are deleted or fail to meet the dead timer interval. In this state, the neighbors usually found are manually configured.\nInit State: The Init State is progressive and involves acknowledging a \"Hello message\" by a router from an OSPF neighbor. The Router receives the message in this state but has not properly established two-way communication with the neighbor.\n2way state: In this state, two-way communication is established when a router sees its ID in the neighbor's Hello packets' field category. A two-way state can also be established when a Data-Based Descriptor packet is received from another neighbor's init state.\nExstart and Exchange state: This state provides a point where OSPF neighbors exchange DBD packets. In this state, the adjacencies between DR & BDR in the network are also built. This state also facilitates to transfer of routing information using Link State Requests in this state.\nLoading state: This state follows the exchange state and is responsible for forwarding LSRs (Link State Requests) by routers to neighbors.
