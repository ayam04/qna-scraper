        "question": "5) Explain the working of XSLT?",
        "answer": "The XSLT stylesheet is written in XML format. It is used to define the transformation rules to be applied on the target XML document. The XSLT processor takes the XSLT stylesheet and applies the transformation rules on the target XML document and then it generates a formatted document in the form of XML, HTML, or text format. At the end it is used by XSLT formatter to generate the actual output and displayed on the end-user.\nImage representation:",

    {
        "question": "6) What are the advantages of using XSLT?",
        "answer": "XSLT provides an easy way to merge XML data into presentation because it applies user defined transformations to an XML document.\nIts output can be HTML, XML, or any other structured document.\nXSLT provides XPath to locate elements/attribute within an XML document. So it is more convenient way to traverse an XML document rather than a traditional way, by using scripting language.\nXSLT is template based. So it is more flexible to changes in documents than low level DOM and SAX.\nXSLT makes the application UI script clean and easier to maintain.\nXSLT templates are based on XPath pattern which is very powerful in terms of performance to process the XML document.\nXSLT can be used as a validation language as it uses tree-pattern-matching approach.\nYou can change the output simply modifying the transformations in XSL files.",
