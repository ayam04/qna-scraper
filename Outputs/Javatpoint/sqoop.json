        "answer": "Sqoop is an acronym that stands for SQL-TO-HADOOP. Apache Sqoop is a tool used to import data from various types of relational databases. It is an open-source framework and a command-line interface application provided by Apache for transferring data between relational databases (MySQL / PostgreSQL / Oracle / SQL Server / DB2 etc.) and Hadoop (HIVE, HDFS, HBase, etc.). Using Apache Sqoop, we can import data from various types of databases such as MySQL, HDFS, and Hadoop. It also facilitates us to export data from the Hadoop file.\nApache Sqoop provides mainly two facilities, Sqoop export, and Sqoop import that can be used to extract data from various types of databases. Sqoop is robust as it has wide community support and contributions.",

        "question": "2) What is the main usage of Sqoop?",
        "answer": "Sqoop is mainly used for transferring the immense data between the relational database and the Hadoop ecosystem. The entire database or individual table is imported to the ecosystem (HDFS), and after modification, it is exported to the database. The Sqoop helps to support the multiple loads in one database table.",

        "question": "3) What is the difference between Sqoop and Flume?",
        "answer": "Sqoop and Flume are the Apache tools used for moving data. Let's see the key differences between them.\nSqoop Flume\nApache Sqoop is a useful Hadoop tool for importing data from RDBMS. Apache Flume is a service mainly designed for streaming logs into the Hadoop environment.\nApache Sqoop has connector-based architecture. Apache Flume has an agent-based architecture.\nIt works efficiently with any type of RDBMS that has JDBC connectivity. It works well for streaming data sources generated continuously in the Hadoop environment, such as log files from multiple servers.\nIn Apache Sqoop, data import is not event-driven. In Apache Flume, data load is event-driven.\nIn Apache Sqoop, HDFS is the destination for importing data. In Apache Flume, data flows into HDFS through one or more channels.\nApache Sqoop provides direct input. For example, it can map relational databases and import them directly into Hadoop frameworks such as HBase and Hive. Apache Flume provides high throughput and low latency.\nApache Sqoop makes data analysis efficient and easy. Apache Flume has a declarative configuration but provides easy extensibility.\nApache Sqoop is the best choice if the data is stored in databases like Oracle, Teradata, MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, etc. Apache Flume is the best choice when we have to move bulk streaming data from various sources like JMS or spooling directory.\nApache Sqoop is mainly used for parallel data transfer and imports as it copies data quickly. Apache Flume is mainly used for collecting and aggregating data because of its distributed and reliable nature and highly available backup routes.\nSeveral companies are using Apache Sqoop in their projects. For example, the Apollo group (an education company) uses Apache Sqoop to extract data from external databases and inject results of Hadoop jobs back into the RDBMS.\nAlso, coupons.com is using Apache Sqoop for data transferring between its IBM Netezza data warehouse and the Hadoop environment. Several companies also use Apache Flume. For example, Mozilla uses Apache Flume for the BuildBot project and Elastic Search.\nCapillary technologies use Apache Flume for aggregating logs.\nGoibibo uses Apache Flume for transferring logs from the production systems into HDFS.",

        "question": "4) What do you understand by Apache Sqoop eval?",
        "answer": "The Apache Sqoop eval tool is used for the sample demo for the import data. It is a permit that the users need to run the sample RDBMS queries and examine the results on the console. Because of the eval tool, it is possible to recognize output and know what kind of data is imported.",

    },
    {
        "question": "5) How can you import large objects like BLOB and CLOB in Apache Sqoop?",
        "answer": "The Apache Sqoop does not support the direct import function in the case of CLOB and BLOB objects. So, in the case you want to import large objects like BLOB and CLOB in Apache Sqoop, you can use JDBC-based imports. You can do this without introducing the direct argument of the import utility.",

    },
    {
        "question": "6) Does Apache Sqoop use MapReduce?",
        "answer": "Apache Sqoop uses Mapreduce for parallel import and exports the data between the database and the Hadoop file system. It is mainly used for fault resistance.",
        "reference": "javatpoint.com"
    },
    {
        "question": "7) What do you understand by Sqoop Import? Why is it used?",
        "answer": "Sqoop Import is a tool used to import tables from RDBMS to HDFS. When the data is imported from the table to HDFS, each row in a table is considered a record in HDFS. Also, all text files and records are there as text data. Avro and sequence files and their all records are there as binary data here. So, we can say that Sqoop Import imports individual tables from RDBMS to HDFS.",

    },
    {
        "question": "8) What are the key advantages of using Apache Sqoop?",
        "answer": "Following is a list of the key advantages of using Apache Sqoop:\nSupport parallel data transfer and fault tolerance\nSqoop uses the Hadoop YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) framework for import and export processes that facilitate parallel data transfer. YARN also provides a fault tolerance facility.\nImport only the required data\nApache Sqoop imports only the required data. It imports a subset of rows from a database table returned from an SQL query.\nSupport all major RDBMS\nSqoop supports all major RDBMS, including MySQL, Postgres, Oracle RDB, SQLite, etc., to connect to the HDFS. When we want to connect to an RDBMS, the database requires JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) and a connector that supports JDBC. Due to its support for fully loading tables, data can be directly loaded into Hive/HBase/HDFS. The other parts of the table can be loaded whenever they are updated using the feature of incremental load.\nLoads data directly into Hive/HBase/HDFS\nApache Sqoop imports data from an RDBMS database directly into Hive, HBase, or HDFS for further analysis. Here, HBase is a NoSQL database, but Sqoop can also import data into HBase.\nA single command for loading data\nSqoop provides a single command to load all the tables from a particular RDBMS database to Hadoop.\nSupport Compressing\nSqoop provides deflate (gzip) algorithm and -compress argument to compress data. We can also perform compression using the -compression-codec argument and load the compressed tables onto Hive.\nSupport Kerberos Security Integration\n\nSqoop provides support for Kerberos Security authentication too. Kerberos is a computer network authentication protocol that uses 'tickets' to allow nodes interacting over a non-secure point to prove their identity to each other in a secure manner.",

        "question": "10) What is the default file format to import data using Apache Sqoop?",
        "answer": "Sqoop allows us to import data using the following two file formats:\nDelimited Text File Format\nThe delimited text file format is the default file format to import data using Apache Sqoop. This file format explicitly uses the -as-textfile argument to the import command in Sqoop. When we pass this as an argument to the command, it produces the string-based representation of all the records to the output files with the delimiter characters between rows and columns.\nSequence File Format\n\nThe Sequence File Format is a binary file format. In this file format, the records are stored in custom record-specific data types shown as Java classes. Sqoop automatically creates these data types and manifests them as java classes.",

        "question": "15) If the source data gets updated now and then, how will you synchronize the data in HDFS that Sqoop imports?",
        "answer": "If the source data gets updated now and then, we can use the incremental parameter with data import to synchronize the data. There are two ways to use the incremental parameter:\nAppend:\nGenerally, we should use incremental import with append option if the source data gets updated now and then or if the table is updated continuously with new rows and increasing row id values. It is also used where values of some of the columns are checked, and if it discovers any modified value for those columns, then it inserts only a new row.\nLastmodified:\nIn this kind of incremental import, the source has a date column that is checked continuously. Any records that have been updated after the last import based on the lastmodifed column in the source, the values would be updated.",
