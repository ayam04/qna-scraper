        "question": "1) What is PySpark? / What do you know about PySpark?",
        "answer": "PySpark is a tool or interface of Apache Spark developed by the Apache Spark community and Python to support Python to work with Spark. This tool collaborates with Apache Spark using APIs written in Python to support features like Spark SQL, Spark DataFrame, Spark Streaming, Spark Core, Spark MLlib, etc. It provides an interactive PySpark shell to analyze structured and semi-structured data in a distributed environment and process them by providing optimized APIs that help the program to read data from various data sources. PySpark features are implemented in the py4j library in Python. Due to the availability of the Py4j library, it facilitates users to work with RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets) in the Python programming language. Python supports many libraries that support big data processing and machine learning.\nYou can install PySpark using PyPi by using the following command:\npip install pyspark",

You can learn and implement it easily if you know Python and Apache Spark.\nPySpark is simple to use. It provides parallelized codes that are simple to write.\nError handling is simple in the PySpark framework. You can easily handle errors and manage synchronization points\nPySpark is a Python API for Apache Spark. It provides great library support. Python has a huge library collection for working in data science and data visualization compared to other languages.\nMany important algorithms are already written and implemented in Spark. It provides many algorithms in Machine Learning or Graphs.\nDisadvantages of PySpark\nPySpark is based on Hadoop's MapReduce model, so sometimes, it becomes challenging to manage and express problems using the MapReduce model.\nSince Apache Spark was originally written in Scala while using PySpark in Python programs, they are not as efficient as other programming models. It is approximate 10x times slower than the Scala programs. Due to this reason, it negatively impacts the performance of heavy data processing applications.\nThe Spark Streaming API in PySpark is not as efficient as Scala. It still requires improvements.\nIn PySpark, the nodes are abstracted, and it uses the abstracted network, so it cannot be used to modify the internal function of the Spark. Scala is preferred in this case.",

It is a core data structure of PySpark.\nRDD is a low-level object that is highly efficient in performing distributed tasks.\nRDD is best to do low-level transformations, operations, and control on a dataset.\nRDD is mainly used to alter data with functional programming structures than with domain-specific expressions.\nIf you have a similar arrangement of data that needs to be calculated again, RDDs can be efficiently reserved.\nRDD contains all datasets and DataFrames in PySpark.\nDataFrame\nA DataFrame is equivalent to a relational table in Spark SQL. It facilitates the structure like lines and segments to be seen.\nIf you are working on Python, it is best to start with DataFrames and then switch to RDDs if you want more flexibility.\nOne of the biggest disadvantages of DataFrames is Compile Time Wellbeing. For example, if the information structure is unknown, you cannot control it.\nDataSet\nA Dataset is a distributed collection of data. It is a subset of DataFrames.\nDataset is a newly added interface in Spark 1.6 to provide RDD benefits.\nDataSet consists of the best encoding component. It provides time security in an organized manner, unlike information edges.\nDataSet provides a greater level of type safety at compile-time. It can be used if you want typed JVM objects.\nBy using DataSet, you can take advantage of Catalyst optimization. You can also use it to benefit from Tungsten's fast code generation.",

It enhances the execution speed as transformations on partitioned data run quicker because each partition's transformations are executed in parallel. PySpark supports both partitioning in memory (DataFrame) and partitioning on disc (File system). When we make a DataFrame from a file or table, PySpark creates the DataFrame in memory with a specific number of divisions based on specified criteria.\nIt also facilitates us to create a partition on multiple columns using partitionBy() by passing the columns you want to partition as an argument to this method.\nSyntax:\npartitionBy(self, *cols)  \nIn PySpark, it is recommended to have 4x of partitions to the number of cores in the cluster available for application.",

        "answer": "Hive is used in HQL (Hive Query Language), and Spark SQL is used in Structured Query language for processing and querying data.
