        "question": "1) What is Blue Prism?",
        "answer": "Blue Prism is one of the leading software development companies in the automation area. It is a UK-based company helping organizations with one of its popular RPA tools, Blue Prism. The term RPA, which is an acronym of 'Robotic Process Automation', was first introduced by the Blue Prism group.\nThe Blue Prism tool is primarily designed to create software robots (also called bots). These software robots are nothing but a set of pre-defined commands that help automate rule-based, repetitive tasks, and eliminate or reduce humans work.",
        "reference": "javatpoint.com"
    },
    {
        "question": "2) What does RPA stand for?",
        "answer": "RPA is the short form of \"Robotic Process Automation\". RPA is a special kind of automation technique in which software robots perform a human's tasks. These tasks generally include repetitive, rule-based, and manual processes. The technique helps organizations automate their digital processes across various applications and systems without changing the existing systems or IT infrastructure.\nRobotic: Set of codes that acts like a robot and mimic human actions.\nProcess: Sequence of steps that creates a meaningful activity is known as the process.\nAutomation: The process performed by software robots without human interaction.",

        "question": "5) What is meant by Environmental variables in context to Blue Prism?",
        "answer": "In Blue Prism, the Environmental variables are special kinds of variables that can remain available for all business processes and objects. Generally, the environmental variables are used as dynamic variables. This makes the availability of these variables easier. Therefore, they can be used whenever there is a requirement of environmental variables throughout the Blue Prism operation.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe following are the steps to use environmental variables in Blue Prism:\nFirst, add new data items in the particular 'Process' or 'Object'.\nClick on the 'Data Properties'.\nSelect the 'Environment' option from the 'Exposure' combo-box.\nAfter that, the 'edit box' will change to 'combo box'. Using a combo box, one can select the required environment variable.\nThen, click 'OK'.",

        "answer": "There are several components present in the Blue Prism tool. However, the main components are:\nProcess Studio\nObject Studio\nProcess Studio: A process studio is defined as the area in the Blue Prism tool that allows developers to create process diagrams for the processes to be automated. The process studio consists of various options, such as variables, control loops, object calls, and business logic, etc. Every process created here includes the Main Page that is executed first.\nObject Studio: To automate most business processes, organizations must establish communication with external software or applications. Since Process Studio does not allow this, Object Studio is included in Blue Prism to perform this functionality. Object Studio allows developers to create VBO (Visual Business Objects).",

        "question": "12) What is the role of action? How can we publish action in Blue Prism?",
        "answer": "In Blue Prism, Actions are responsible for implementing the logic of business objects. Every action includes data items that store information required for existing action along with various stages. Typically, actions start from the 'Start' stage and finish at the 'End' stage. In between 'Start' and 'end' stages, other necessary stages are inserted to help us carry out the specific result with the automation process.\n\nWhen we want to publish an Action, we need first to call it using any existing process or a program. Then, we are required to right-click on the particular action and select the 'Publish' option listed in the menu box. Once the action is published, there will be an icon next to the action's name.

        "question": "20) Why do we say that RPA Blue Prism offers a secure and auditable automation platform?",
        "answer": "Blue Prism offers security and audibility at different levels; therefore, it is known as the secure and auditable automation platform. Blue Prism provides a separate run-time environment, which means that the run-time environment is segregated from a process-editing environment. Additionally, several permissions can be assigned to specific users. With these permissions, tasks like designing, creating, editing, and executing processes can be limited only to the assigned and authorized users.\nWhen it comes to auditing, Blue Prism provides a complete audit trail for the processes. It includes a full comparison report of effects that occurred before and after making any change to the processes. Also, it contains a detailed log reports generated at run-time for each process. The log report consists of a time-stamped history of every change provided to automated processes.",

The document contains the manual processes that are to be automated. It consists of a process diagram and detailed descriptions of all the stages based on the organization's requirements.\nFRQ: It is a short form of 'Functional Requirements Questionnaire'. It includes the checklist of the necessary information as well as some other areas that need consideration.\nSDD: It is a short form of 'Solution Design Document'. PDD and FRQ act as input for SDD.

        "question": "How can we configure priorities for work queues?",
        "answer": "Work Queues in Blue Prism are generally implemented to break large volumes of work into multiple small volumes. Additionally, it is said to be the most effective way for the deployments of bots. It is because multiple bots are implemented to decrease the overall time consumption during the separation of large volumes of work to small volumes.\nBesides, we are required to set the priorities for the work queue item when we are working in queues. To configure the priority, we need to follow these steps:\nWe are first required to add an item in the corresponding queue with the help of the existing 'Add to Queue' action.\nThen, we are required to work with the existing queue item. It will set the start-priority of the created process.\nOnce the priority of the item is added, we can repeat the same with more items.

Besides, when the Preserve checkbox option is selected, the exception is released without the requirement of any other details. That means the existing exception is thrown again. That is why we use the Preserve checkbox option in the Recovery Mode. The recovery mode resides in between the Resume stage and a Recover stage.\nIn case if we use the checkbox outside the recovery mode, it will provide an exception.",

Blue Prism mark such processes as an Exception at Clean-Up to identify that the process could not get completed.\nIn case if we are going to use a second method, then we are first required to select a process session. After that, we need to double-click on it. It will display the following two option:\nRequest Stop: It is used to stop a running process at a configured safe stop.\nImmediate Stop: It is used to stop a running process immediately.

However, it is much slower than the default Win32 interface. It is recommended to use the active accessibility interface only when elements are not compatible with the default interface. Additionally, it can be used when elements are not reliable enough to target using the spy mode present in the Win32 interface. The active accessibility interface is mostly used during the automation of Windows-native applications.\nWe can slightly improve the overall performance of the active accessibility interface with the help of Match Index and Match Reverse. The interface may provide multiple matches, even where there is a single element. The reason for this is the existence of some hidden elements which are not generally displayed.",

Typically, the wait in the starting of any action confirms the correctness of path and results in increased process resilience. The default timeout in the Wait stage is 5 seconds. The process will wait before performing an action until the timeout that the user has specified for the Wait stage upon running the object has passed.\nAlways throw an exception on timeout: One should not try to retrieve the process through the Wait stage. Besides, one should try an exception and let the process control and handle it. It may restart the system, or retry after an alert, or retry after some time.\nAlways with for the screen to change: One should use the wait stages after navigating to any stage that might be a cause to update screen.
