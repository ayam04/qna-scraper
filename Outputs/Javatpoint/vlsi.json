        "question": "6) What are the different gates where Boolean logic is used?",
        "answer": "There are mainly three types of gates used in Boolean logic:\nNOT Gate: The NOT gate is a logic gate that is used to implement logical negation. It has one input and one output. For example, if A = 0, then the Value of B =1 and vice versa.\nAND Gate: The AND gate is a logic gate that implements logical conjunction. It has one output due to the combination of two outputs. For example, if A and B = 1, then the value of output should be 1. On the other hand, if any input value is 0, then the output will be 0.\nOR Gate: The OR gate is a logic gate that is used to implement logical disjunction. If the value of one or both the inputs to the gate is 1, the output will be 1. If both the inputs are 0, the output will be 0. For example, if A's value is 1 or B is 0, then the value of output will be 1.\nNote: The above are the basic three types of gates where Boolean logic works. Apart from these, there are some other gates that work with the combination of these three basic gates. They are the XNOR gate, NAND gate, NOR gate, and the XOR gate.",

        "question": "9) What is the meaning of \"the channel is pinched off\"?",
        "answer": "For a MOSFET, when the voltage value between Gate and Source (VGS) is greater than the threshold voltage (Vt), the channel is induced. As we increase, VDS current starts flowing from Drain to Source till the voltage between gate and channel at the drain end becomes Vt, i.e., VGS - VDS = Vt, the channel depth at Drain end decreases almost to zero. At this stage, the channel is said to be pinched off. In this condition, the MOSFET enters the saturation region.",

It needs to be mentioned in this skew. The delays are not measured while the clock is uniform for both.\nUseful skew: The useful skew is used to define the delay in capturing flip flop paths, which later helps set up an environment with precise requirements for the launch and capture of the timing path.

That's why the output goes into an unresolved state for an unbounded interval of time. Metastability is used in designing a system that violates the setup or holds time requirements. The setup time requirement needs the data to be stable before the clock edge, and the hold time requires the data to be stable after the clock edge has passed.

The clock works as a filter providing the minor reset glitches in this reset, but the glitches occur on the active clock edge. Asynchronous Reset is also known as reset release or reset removal. In this reset, it is the designer's responsibility to add the reset to the data paths.\nSynchronous reset requires an active clock that provides specific clock-cycle-related latency and may impact the timing of the data paths. Asynchronous reset does not require an active clock to bring flip-flops to a known state. Therefore, it has lower latency than synchronous reset.",
