A Generator is used to generate electricity for large-scale requirements or supplies.\nIn Alternator, electricity is produced by spinning the magnetic field inside the windings of the copper wire. A generator uses dynamo to convert mechanical energy to electrical energy. It works on the principle of electromagnetic induction.\nAlternators use only the required amount of energy. So, they conserve more energy. Generators use all the energy that is produced. So, they conserve less energy.\nAn alternator always induces an alternating current (AC). A generator can generate either alternating (AC) or direct current (DC).\nAlternators are considered very efficient. Generators are considered less efficient.\nIt doesn't require polarization in the case of alternators. Polarization is required after installation in the case of generators.\nIn Alternator, the magnetic field is rotating inside the stator. In Generator, the magnetic field is stationary or fixed, and the armature winding spins.\nThe armature of an alternator is always stationary. The armature of the Generator is rotating.\nThe Alternator receives the input supply from the stator. The Generator receives the input supply from the rotor.\nAlternators generate voltage only when needed. Generators produce voltage at all times.\nAlternators run on a high range of RPM. Generators run on a high range of RPM.\nAlternators are generally smaller in size. Generators are generally larger and require more space to fit in.\nAlternators can never charge a dead battery. A generator can be used to charge a dead battery.\nThe brushes of alternators are long-lasting. The brushes of generators are lesser long-lasting when compared to an alternator.\nAlternators are mainly used in the automobile industry as a charging system for the battery. Generators are mainly used to produce large-scale electricity.",
