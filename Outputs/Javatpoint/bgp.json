        "question": "1) What is BGP? What is the full form of BGP?",
        "answer": "BGP stands for Border Gateway Protocol. It is a standardized exterior gateway protocol designed to exchange routing and provide information among autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet. BGP is mainly used for routing within an autonomous system. In this application, it is called Interior Border Gateway Protocol, Internal BGP, or iBGP. As the other use, the internet application of this protocol is called Exterior Border Gateway Protocol, External BGP, or eBGP.\nWe can classify the Border Gateway Protocol as a path vector protocol. It makes routing decisions according to paths, network policies, or rule sets configured by a network administrator. It is also involved in making core routing decisions. For example, when two ISPs connect, they typically use BGP to exchange routing information.",

    {
        "question": "2) Can Routers on different subnets become BGP neighbours?",
        "answer": "BGP is usually configured between two directly connected routers that belong to different autonomous systems. BGP routers do not need neighbours to be attached to the same subnet. Instead, they use a TCP connection between the routers to pass BGP messages and allowing neighbouring routers to be on the same or different subnet.\nADVERTISEMENT",

        "question": "3) What is the main purpose of BGP?",
        "answer": "The main purpose of BGP is to exchange routing updates like other routing protocols, but generally, it does not exchange individual network routes. It exchanges summaries of network routes. That's why it is typically used over very large networks, including the Internet.",

        "question": "4) What are some basic characteristics of BGP?",
        "answer": "BGP is a path-vector protocol or an exterior gateway protocol (EGP) used in routing on the Internet. Following are the most common characteristics of BGP:\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nBGP uses TCP port 179 to establish connections with neighbours and transfer data to ensure reliable protocol updates delivery.\nIt sends updates only when changes occur in the network (no periodic updates).\nIt periodically sends keepalive messages to verify TCP connections.\nThe metric of the protocol is called path-vector or attributes.\nBGP uses several attributes in the routing-decision algorithm.\nBGP is an interdomain routing protocol.\nBGP is a path-vector routing protocol that is best suited for strategic routing policies.\nIt uses confederations and route reflectors to reduce BGP peering overhead.\nBGPv4 implements CIDR.\neBGP is used for external neighbours between different autonomous systems.\niBGP is used for internal neighbours within the same autonomous system.\nIt uses MED (metric) attributes between autonomous systems to influence inbound traffic.\nIt uses weight to influence the path of outbound traffic from a single router configured locally.",

        "question": "8) Can we use BGP instead of any IGP?",

        "question": "13) What do you understand by loop prevention mechanism in BGP?",
        "answer": "There are two types of loop prevention mechanisms in BGP:\nWhen an iBGP peer specifies routes for a router, that router does not advertise the same routes to another iBGP peer.\nBy using AS_PATH: When we advertise to an eBGP peer, a BGP router adds its own ASN to the AS_PATH. If a BGP router receives an update and the route advertisement lists an AS_PATH with its ASN, it ignores that route.\nNote: A BGP router does not add its ASN when advertising to an iBGP peer.",

        "question": "14) What is the difference between Hard Reset and Soft Reset in BGP?",
        "answer": "In BGP terminology, the administrators are required to reset BGP peers. There are two ways to reset a peer:\nHard Reset\nSoft Reset\nLet's see the differences between Hard Reset and Soft Reset in a tabular form:\nComparison Parameter Hard Reset Soft Reset\nPrimary Goal Hard Reset kills the TCP session with the BGP neighbour forcing it to restart. It kills the TCP connection between the peers, re-establishes the connection with a BGP open message, and proceeds with the regular message exchanges between peers. A soft reset is of 2 types:\n1. Soft reset with Route refresh: Soft reset with Route refresh allows BGP peers to request an update without killing the entire neighbour relationship.\n2. Soft-reconfiguration: Soft-reconfiguration stores a copy of BGP routes delivered in the BGP update from our peer because the route-refresh request is not sent to the BGP neighbour.\nDirection Both In and Out Either In or Out\nImpact The hard reset can severely disrupt the reachability of all networks. The soft reset can impact only those prefixes that are affected by the policy change.\nUsage Hard Reset should be used only as a last option when soft reset cannot address the issue. Soft is the most preferred approach, and it is mostly used.\nMemory usage It doesn't require any additional memory requirement for storing another table. It requires additional memory since the router now stores another table for each neighbour instead of one BGP table.\nPrerequisite It doesn't require any prerequisites. Both peers may be required to support the Route Refresh capability in soft reset with the Route refresh feature.\nConvergence time It requires a very long convergence time since the processing of the full table takes a long time. Its convergence time is much shorter than a hard reset.\nRelated commands clear ip bgp {* | neighbor ip | peer-group} clear ip bgp {neighbor ip} soft out\nclear ip bgp {neighbor ip} soft in",

        "answer": "BGP Message types are used to establish a neighbour relationship and exchange parameters, including autonomous system number and authentication values. Following is a list of some BGP Message types:\nOpen: The open message type creates a neighbour relationship and exchanges BGP parameters, including AS number and authentication values.\nKeepalive: The Keepalive BGP message type is sent periodically to maintain the neighbour relationship. If the Keepalive message is not received within the negotiated Hold Time, the BGP neighborship is turned down.\nUpdate: This message type is used to exchange the path attributes and the associated prefix/length that uses those attributes.\nNotification: This message type is used to report BGP errors.

        "answer": "BGP supports several Path Attributes varieties and uses these path Attributes to check the competing BGP paths (routes) in the BGP table to find out the best possible path (route).\n\nFollowing is a list of some BGP Path Attributes:\nNext Hop: The Next Hop Path Attributes is used to list the next-hop IP address to reach a prefix. It checks if the Next hop is reachable. If no route is able to reach Next Hop, the router does not use this route.\nWeight: The weight Path Attributes is a numeric value set by a router when you receive the updates to influence the route for a prefix. It is not advertised to any BGP peers, and a bigger weight is preferred.\nLocal Preference: This is also a numeric value set. It is communicated within a single autonomous system to choose the best route for all routers in that autonomous system to reach a certain network. The bigger value is preferred.\nLocally injected routes: Locally injected routes are the routes injected using the network command. These are better than iBGP/eBGP.\nMulti-Exit Discriminator (MED) allows an autonomous system to tell the neighbouring autonomous system the best path to forward packets. Smaller is preferred.\nAS Path: It specifies the number of ASNs in the AS Path. Smaller is preferred.",
