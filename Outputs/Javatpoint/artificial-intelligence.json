Data is gathered through a survey or with the help of web scraping tools. The data collection depends on the type of model, and we want to create. It generally includes the transaction details, personal details, shopping, etc.\nData Cleaning: The irrelevant or redundant data is removed in this step. The inconsistency present in the data may lead to wrong predictions.\nData exploration & analysis: This is one of the most crucial steps in which we need to find out the relation between different predictor variables.\nBuilding Models: Now, the final step is to build the model using different machine learning algorithms depending on the business requirement. Such as Regression or classification.",

        "question": "46) Give the steps for A* algorithm?",
        "answer": "A* algorithm is the popular form of the Best first search. It tries to find the shortest path using the heuristic function with the cost function to reach the end node. The steps for A* algorithms are given below:\nStep 1: Put the first node in the OPEN list.\nStep 2: Check if the OPEN list is empty or not; if the list is empty, then return failure and stops.\nStep 3: Select the node from the OPEN list which has the smallest value of evaluation function (g+h), if node n is goal node then return success and stop, otherwise\nStep 4: Expand node n and generate all of its successors, and put n into the closed list. For each successor n', check whether n' is already in the OPEN or CLOSED list; if not, then compute evaluation function for n' and place into Open list.\nStep 5: Else if node n' is already in OPEN and CLOSED list, then it should be attached to the back pointer, which reflects the lowest g(n') value.\nStep 6: Return to Step 2.",

        "question": "47) What is the inference engine, and why it is used in AI?",
        "answer": "In artificial intelligence, the inference engine is the part of an intelligent system that derives new information from the knowledge base by applying some logical rules.\nIt mainly works in two modes:\nBackward Chaining: It begins with the goal and proceeds backward to deduce the facts that support the goal.\nForward Chaining: It starts with known facts, and asserts new facts.",

        "question": "48) What do you understand by the fuzzy logic?",
        "answer": "Fuzzy logic is a method of reasoning applied to the AI, which resembles human reasoning. Here the word \"fuzzy\" defines things that are not clear, it means the situations where it is difficult to decide if the state is True or False. It involves all the possibilities that occur between Yes and NO.\nThe below diagram shows the difference between fuzzy logic and Boolean logic\n\nSince it resembles human reasoning, hence it can be used in neural networks.",

        "question": "49) What is a Bayesian network, and why is it important in AI?",
        "answer": "Bayesian networks are the graphical models that are used to show the probabilistic relationship between a set of variables. It is a directed cycle graph that contains multiple edges, and each edge represents a conditional dependency.\nBayesian networks are probabilistic, because these networks are built from a probability distribution, and also use probability theory for prediction and anomaly detection. It is important in AI as it is based on Bayes theorem and can be used to answer the probabilistic questions.",

        "question": "50) What is a heuristic function, and where is it used?",
        "answer": "The heuristic function is used in Informed Search, and it finds the most promising path. It takes the current state of the agent as its input and produces the estimation of how close the agent is from the goal. The heuristic method, however, might not always give the best solution, but it guaranteed to find a good solution in a reasonable time. Heuristic function estimates how close a state is to the goal. It is represented by h(n), and it calculates the cost of an optimal path between the pair of states. The value of the heuristic function is always positive.\nAdmissibility of the heuristic function is given as:\nh(n) <= h*(n)\nHere h(n) is heuristic cost, and h*(n) is the estimated cost. Hence heuristic cost should be less than or equal to the estimated cost.",
