        "answer": "Electron, proton, and neutron are the building block of an atom. The discovery of electrons, protons, and neutron is very interesting. Let's see the history of their discovery in detail.\nElectron\nJ.J. Thomson discovered electrons in 1897. At that time, J. Thomson was experimenting with cathode ray tubes, and he saw that all atoms contain some tiny negatively charged subatomic particles or electrons. The electrons are the lightest and negatively charged particles within an atom. He saw that the velocity of cathode rays was much less than the speed of light.\nSo, he devised a new way to measure cathode rays' charge to mass ratio. He concluded that the cathode rays are the 11000th mass of hydrogen ion (which is a proton).\nCharacteristics of an Electron\nADVERTISEMENT\nAn electron has a negligible mass. The relative mass of an electron is 11840 u.\nThe absolute charge is -1.6 \u00d7 10-19 coulomb of negative charge.\nProton\nA proton is a stable subatomic particle, denoted by p, p+, H+, or 1H+ and has a positive electric charge. E. Goldstein saw the first sign of proton in an atom in 1886. Goldstein experimented, and he passed electricity at high voltage through gas at very low pressure. He saw a stream of heavy particles by the anode (positive electrode). These streams of particles were called canal rays or anode rays. Later, Ernest Rutherford discovered protons and named them. Protons reside inside the nucleus along with the neutron. So, he is known as the inventor of the proton.\nCharacteristics of a Proton\nThe mass of a proton is slightly less than a neutron and 1836 times the mass of an electron. The relative mass of a proton is 1 u.\nThe charge of a proton is equal to and opposite to the charge of an electron. The absolute charge is 1.6 \u00d7 10-19 coulomb of positive charge.\nProtons and neutrons, each with masses of approximately one atomic mass unit, are jointly referred to as \"nucleons\".\nEvery atom has one or more protons in the nucleus, which must provide an attractive electrostatic central force to bind atomic electrons.\nNeutron\nA neutron is a stable subatomic particle, denoted by n or n0, with a neutral (not positive or negative) charge. The mass of a neutron is slightly greater than a proton. Protons and neutrons both make the nuclei of atoms. Sir James Chadwick, the British Physicist, is credited as the inventor of neutrons.

The pH of an acid is determined by the concentration of Hydrogen ions (H+) the substance contains when it is in solution. The higher the concentration of H+ ions, makes the pH lower and the substance more acidic. All acids contain hydrogen ions when they are in solution.\nIn Chemistry, pH stands for \"potential of hydrogen\". It is a measuring scale used to measure the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution. Acidic solutions are measured to have lower pH values, and the basic or alkaline solutions have higher pH values.\npH Value Nature of the substance\n0-3 The pH value within 0-3 specifies that the substance is a strong acid. In this case, the UI turns red.\n4-6 weak acid (UI turns orange/yellow) The pH value within 4-6 specifies that the substance is a weak acid. In this case, the UI turns orange/yellow.\n7 neutral (UI turns green) The pH value of 7 specifies that the substance is neutral. It means it is not acidic or basic. In this case, the UI turns green.\n8-10 weak alkali (UI turns blue) The pH value within 4-6 specifies that the substance is weak alkali. It means it is basic but not strong. In this case, the UI turns blue.\n11-14 strong alkali (UI turns purple) The pH value within 4-6 specifies that the substance is strong alkali. In this case, the UI turns purple.\n\nHere, UI means Universal Indicator. It is a solution that changes color according to the pH of the substance.",

It can be used in any type of chemical mixture, but most frequently, it is used with solutions, where it refers to the amount of solute dissolved in a solvent. If you want to concentrate a solution, you must add more solute or reduce the amount of solvent. On the other hand, if you want to dilute a solution, you must add more solvent or reduce the amount of solute.\nThere are several types of concentration for a solution or a mixture.

An atom of each element has a definite combining capacity known as its valence or valency. So, we can say that the valence or valency of an element is the measurement of its combining capacity with other atoms in forming a chemical compound or molecule.\nThe number of hydrogen atoms determines the combining capacity of an atom of a specific element that it combines with. For example, in water, oxygen has a valency of 2. That's why it is called H2O. Let's see the valency of different atoms in different compounds.\nIn methane, carbon has a valency of 4. That's why the chemical formula of methane is CH4.\nIn ammonia, nitrogen has a valency of 3. That's why the chemical formula of ammonia is NH3.\nIn hydrogen chloride, chlorine has a valency of 1. That's why the chemical formula of hydrogen chloride is HCl.\nIn phosphorus pentachloride, phosphorus has a valence of 5. That's why the chemical formula of phosphorus pentachloride is PCl5.\nTo represent the valency in pictorial format, we use valence diagrams. The valence diagram of a compound represents the connectivity of the elements. It consists of lines drawn between two elements, sometimes called bonds, representing a saturated valency for each element.",

        "answer": "In Chemistry, a buffer is a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid. Buffers work by reacting with any added acid or base to control the pH of the solution. It neutralizes any added acid (H+ ions) or base (OH- ions) to maintain the moderate pH, making them a weaker acid or base. When we add a hydrogen ion to the buffer, it is neutralized by the base in the buffer, and the acid neutralizes the hydroxide ion. On the overall pH of the buffer solution, these neutralization reactions will not show much effect.\nExample: Let's take a buffer made up of the weak base ammonia, NH3, and its conjugate acid, NH4+. When we add a strong acid (HCl) to this buffer system, the extra H+ ions added to the system are consumed by the NH3 and form NH4+. Now, because all the extra H+ ions are locked up and have formed a weaker acid, NH4+, thus the pH of the system does not change significantly.",

Primordial Isotopes\nPrimordial isotopes are the types of isotopes that have existed since the solar system's formation. There are a total of 339 naturally occurring isotopes on Earth, of which 286 isotopes are primordial.\n3. Radioactive Isotopes\nThe isotopes which are radioactive in nature are called radioactive isotopes. These isotopes have unstable atomic nuclei that undergo radioactive decay continuously.\nSome examples of radioactive isotopes are carbon-14, hydrogen-3 (also known as tritium), chlorine-36, uranium-235, uranium-238, etc.\nMost of the chemical element has one or more radioactive isotopes. For example, hydrogen, the lightest element on the periodic chart, has three isotopes with mass numbers 1, 2, and 3. Here, only hydrogen-3 is a radioactive isotope, and the other two are stable.\nThere are more than 1000 radioactive isotopes known of the different elements. Of these 1000 radioactive isotopes, only approximately 50 are found in nature; and the rest are produced artificially as the direct products of nuclear reactions or created indirectly as the radioactive descendants of these products.\nApplication of Isotopes\nIsotopes have many useful applications in our daily life.

        "question": "26) Which chemicals are used in fireworks to provide different colors?",
        "answer": "Fireworks use different chemicals and chemical reactions to provide different colors. Two things happen in fireworks incandescence (light created through heat) and luminescence (light without heat). Here, one thing is notable orange, red and white colors are usually made through incandescence, and blues and green colors are usually made through luminescence.\nNote: Japan witnessed the largest single firework in 1988. The burst was over 1 kilometer across.\nFollowing are the chemicals used to provide different colors:\nChemical Color\nCalcium It produces orange color in fireworks.\nStrontium and Lithium These chemicals produce red color in fireworks.\nIron It produces gold color in fireworks.\nSodium It produces yellow color in fireworks.\nMagnesium or Aluminium These chemicals produce white color in fireworks.\nBarium plus a Chlorine producing chemical These chemicals produce green color in fireworks.\nCopper plus a Chlorine producing chemical These chemicals produce a blue color in fireworks.\nStrontium plus Copper These chemicals produce purple color in fireworks.\nAluminum or Magnesium powder These chemicals produce a silver color in fireworks.",

        "question": "27) What are the most important features of atoms?",
        "answer": "The word atom is derived from the Greek word \"Atomos,\" which means indivisible or non-divisible. In Greek literature, the prefix \"a\" means \"not,\" and the word \"tomos\" means cut. But nowadays, we know that atoms are made of even smaller subatomic particles known as electrons, protons, and neutrons. Following is the list of the most important features of atoms:\n\nAn atom is the smallest recognized component of a chemical element.\nAn atom comprises three particles: the proton, neutron, and electron.\nMost of the mass (almost 99% of the mass) of the atom is held in the central nucleus, consisting of the protons and neutrons. The negatively charged electrons move around the nucleus in orbital shells of different energies.\nThe number of protons in a nucleus is known as its atomic number.\nUsually, the number of electrons in an atom equals the number of protons. It means the atoms are generally neutralized in nature and have no overall charge.\nWhen an atom gains or losses electrons, it is called an ion.",
