        "question": "1) What is Apache Spark?",
        "answer": "Apache Spark is an open-source, easy to use, flexible, big data framework or unified analytics engine used for large-scale data processing. It is a cluster computing framework for real-time processing. Apache Spark can be set upon Hadoop, standalone, or in the cloud and capable of assessing diverse data sources, including HDFS, Cassandra, and others. Apache Spark provides an interface for entire programming clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance.\nApache Spark is one of the most successful projects in the Apache Software Foundation. It is evolved as the market leader for Big Data processing. Nowadays, many organizations run Spark on clusters with thousands of nodes. Some big companies which have adopted Apache Spark are Amazon, eBay, Yahoo etc.",

    {
        "question": "2) What type of big data problems Apache Spark can solve?",
        "answer": "As we know that Apache Spark is an open-source big data framework. It provides an expressive APIs to facilitate big data professionals to execute streaming and batching efficiently. It is designed for fast computation and also provides a faster and more general data processing platform engine.\nApache Spark was developed at UC Berkeley in 2009 as an Apache project called \"lighting fast cluster computing\". It can distribute data in a file system across the cluster and processes that data in parallel.\nUsing Spark, we can write an application in Java, Python, Scala or R language.",

    {
        "question": "3) What was the need for Apache Spark?",
        "answer": "Many general-purpose cluster computing tools in the market, such as Hadoop MapReduce, Apache Storm, Apache Impala, Apache Giraph and many more. But each one has some limitations in its functionalities.\nWe can see the limitations as:\nADVERTISEMENT\nHadoop MapReduce can only allow for batch processing.\nIf we talk about stream processing, then only Apache Storm / S4 can perform it.\nIf we need interactive processing, then only Apache Impala / Apache Tezcan perform it.\nIf we need to perform graph processing, then only Neo4j / Apache Giraph can do it.\nHere, we can see that no single engine can perform all the tasks together. So, there was a requirement of a powerful engine that can process the data in real-time (streaming) and batch mode and respond to sub-second and perform in-memory processing.\nThis is how Apache Spark comes into existence. It is a powerful open-source engine that offers interactive processing, real-time stream processing, graph processing, in-memory processing and batch processing. It provides a very fast speed, ease of use, and a standard interface simultaneously.",

It supports SQL queries, streaming data as well as graph data processing.\nSpark doesn't need Hadoop to run. It can run on its own using other storages like Cassandra, S3, from which Spark can read and write.\nApache Spark's speed is very high as it can run programs up to 100 times faster in-memory or ten times faster on disk than MapReduce.",

MapReduce can process data in batches only.\nSpeed: The processing speed of Apache Spark is extremely high. It runs almost 100 times faster than Hadoop MapReduce. Hadoop MapReduce is slower than Apache Spark in the case of large scale data processing.\nData Storage: Apache Spark stores data in the RAM, i.e., in-memory. It is easier to retrieve it, and that's why it is best to use in Artificial Intelligence. Hadoop MapReduce stores data in HDFS. So, it takes a long time to retrieve the data from there.\nCaching: Apache Spark provides caching and in-memory data storage. Hadoop MapReduce is highly disk-dependent.",

It is also very fast but not as much as Apache Spark.\nProcessing: It is used for Real-time & Batch processing. This is used for Batch processing only.\nLearning Difficulty: It is easy to learn because of high-level modules. It is tough to learn.\nInteractivity: It has interactive modes.

        "question": "9) What are some key features of Apache Spark?",
        "answer": "Following is the list of some key features of Apache Spark:\nPolyglot: Spark provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R. We can write Spark code in any of these four languages. It provides a shell in Scala and Python. The Scala shell can be accessed through ./bin/spark-shell and Python shell through ./bin/pyspark from the installed directory.\nSpeed: Apache Spark provides an amazing speed upto 100 times faster than Hadoop MapReduce for large-scale data processing. We get this speed in Spark through controlled partitioning.\nMultiple Formats: Apache Spark supports multiple data sources like Parquet, JSON, Hive and Cassandra. These data sources can be more than just simple pipes that convert data, pull it into Spark, and provide a pluggable mechanism to access structured data though Spark SQL.\nEvaluation is lazy: Apache Spark doesn't evaluate itself until it is necessary. That's why it attains an amazing speed. Spark adds them to a DAG of computation for transformations, and they are executed only when the driver requests some data.\nReal-Time Computation: The computation in Apache Spark is done in real-time and has less latency because of its in-memory computation. Spark provides massive scalability, and the Spark team has documented users of the system running production clusters with thousands of nodes and supports several computational models.\n\nHadoop Integration: Apache Spark is smoothly compatible with Hadoop. This is great for all the Big Data engineers who work with Hadoop. Spark is a potential replacement for the MapReduce functions of Hadoop, while Spark can run on top of an existing Hadoop cluster using YARN for resource scheduling.\nMachine Learning: The MLlib of Apache Spark is used as a component of machine learning, which is very useful for big data processing. Using this, you don't need to use multiple tools, one for processing and one for machine learning. Apache Spark is great for data engineers and data scientists because it is a powerful, unified engine that is both fast and easy to use.",

Each application will try to use all available nodes. You can launch a standalone cluster manually by starting a master and workers by hand or using our provided launch scripts. It is also possible to run these daemons on a single machine for testing.\nApache Mesos: Apache Mesos is an open-source project to manage computer clusters and run Hadoop applications. The advantages of deploying Spark with Mesos include dynamic partitioning between Spark and other frameworks and scalable partitioning between multiple instances of Spark.\nHadoop YARN: Apache YARN is the cluster resource manager of Hadoop 2.

        "answer": "The Apache Spark applications run as independent processes coordinated by the SparkSession object in the driver program.\n\nFirst, the resource manager or cluster manager assigns tasks to the worker nodes with one task per partition. Iterative algorithms then apply operations repeatedly to the data so they can benefit from caching datasets across iterations. A task applies its unit of work to the dataset in its partition and outputs a new partition dataset. Finally, the results are sent back to the driver application or can be saved to the disk.",

Spark provides some options to use YARN when dispatching jobs to the cluster, rather than its built-in manager or Mesos.

        "answer": "As the name specifies, lazy evaluation in Apache Spark means that the execution will not start until an action is triggered. In Spark, the lazy evaluation comes into action when Spark transformations occur. Transformations are lazy. When a transformation such as a map() is called on an RDD, it is not performed instantly. Transformations in Spark are not evaluated until you perform an action, which aids in optimizing the overall data processing workflow, known as lazy evaluation.
