        "answer": "NLP stands for \"Natural Language Processing\". NLP is a field of computer science that deals with communication between computer systems and humans. This technique uses Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to create automated software that helps understand the human spoken languages and extract useful information from the data gathered from the audio.\nThe techniques used in NLP allow computer systems to process and interpret data in the form of natural languages. It designs algorithms that can extract meaning from large datasets in audio or text format by applying machine learning algorithms. In other words, we can say that NLP is software that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to understand natural languages or the way human beings read and write in a language and extracts required information from such data.",

        "question": "2) What are some real-life applications / real-world examples of Natural Language Processing (NLP)?",
        "answer": "Some real-life applications of NLP or Natural Language Processing are as follows:\nSpelling/Grammar Checking Apps: Spelling and grammar checking applications are real-life examples of Natural Language Processing. These apps are mainly used in mobile applications and websites that facilitate users to correct grammar mistakes in the entered text rely on NLP algorithms. They also recommend the best possible substitutes that the users might type. This is possible because of specific NLP models being used in the backend.\nGoogle Translate: Google Translate is the most famous application of Natural Language Processing. Using this, you can convert your written or spoken sentences into any language. You can also get the correct pronunciation and meaning of a word by using Google Translate. The Google Translate application uses some advanced techniques of Natural Language Processing to provide translation of sentences into various languages.\nChatbots apps: Chatbots applications provide a better customer support service. Many websites and companies use this to offer customer support through these virtual bots that chat with the user and resolve their problems. Many companies use chatbots for 24/7 service to resolve the basic queries of customers. Generally, it filters the basic issues that do not require an interaction with the companies' customer executives. It makes the customers feel that the customer support team quickly attends them. If a chatbot cannot resolve any user's query, it forwards it to the support team while still engaging the customer. Chatbots also make companies capable of building cordial relations with customers. These all are only possible because of Natural Language Processing.",

        "answer": "Stemming and Lemmatization are both the text normalization techniques used in Natural language Processing. Both are used to prepare text, words, and documents for further processing. They seem very similar techniques, but there are quite differences between them. Let's see the main differences between them:\nStemming Lemmatization\nStemming is the process of extracting the base form of a word by removing the affixes from them. It produces the morphological variants of a root/base word. Stemming programs are commonly known as stemming algorithms or stemmers. Lemmatization is a more advanced process and looks beyond word reduction, just like stemming. It considers a full vocabulary of a language and applies a morphological analysis to words.\nFor example, the lemma of 'went' is 'go', and the lemma of 'mice' is 'mouse'.\nStemming is not as much informative as Lemmatization. It is a somewhat crude method for cataloging related words. It essentially cuts letters from the end until the stem is reached. Lemmatization is much more informative than simple Stemming; that is why Spacy has opted to only have Lemmatization available instead of Stemming.\nStemming is not as efficient as Lemmatization. This method works fairly well in most cases, but unfortunately, English has many exceptions requiring a more sophisticated process. Lemmatization is more efficient than Stemming as it works well in exceptional words.\nFollowing are some examples of Stemming:\nrun: run\nrunner: runner\nrunning: run\nran: ran\nruns: run\neasily: easili\nfairly: fair etc. Following are some examples of Lemmatization:\nrun: run\nrunner: run\nrunning: run\nran: run\nruns: run\ngoes: go\ngo: go\nwent: go\nsaw: see\nmice: mouse",
