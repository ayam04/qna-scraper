        "answer": "In Splunk, transaction, and stats, both commands are used for different purposes. The transaction command is mostly used in two specific cases:\nThe transaction command is used when the unique ID (from one or more fields) alone is not sufficient to discriminate between two transactions. In this case, we have to reuse the identifier. When we have to reuse the identifier, for example, in DHCP logs, a particular message is used to identify the beginning or end of a transaction. For example, web sessions are identified by a cookie/client IP. In this case, the time or pauses are also used to segment the data into transactions.\nIt is also used when we want to see the raw text of events combined rather than an analysis of the constituent fields of the events.\nIn other cases, it is preferred to use stats commands. The performance of the stats command is higher, so it is best suited for distributed search environment. We can also use the stats command in the case of a unique ID.",
