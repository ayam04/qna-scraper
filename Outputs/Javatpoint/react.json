        "question": "1) What is React?",
        "answer": "React is a declarative, efficient, flexible open source front-end JavaScript library developed by Facebook in 2011. It follows the component-based approach for building reusable UI components, especially for single page application. It is used for developing interactive view layer of web and mobile apps. It was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. It was initially deployed on Facebook's News Feed section in 2011 and later used in its products like WhatsApp & Instagram.\nFor More Information, Click here.",

        "question": "3) What are the most crucial advantages of using React?",
        "answer": "Following is a list of the most crucial advantages of using React:\nReact is easy to learn and use\nReact comes with good availability of documentation, tutorials, and training resources. It is easy for any developer to switch from JavaScript background to React and easily understand and start creating web apps using React. Anyone with little knowledge of JavaScript can start building web applications using React.\nReact follows the MVC architecture.\nReact is the V (view part) in the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture model and is referred to as \"one of the JavaScript frameworks.\" It is not fully featured but has many advantages of the open-source JavaScript User Interface (UI) library, which helps execute the task in a better manner.\nReact uses Virtual DOM to improve efficiency.\nReact uses virtual DOM to render the view. The virtual DOM is a virtual representation of the real DOM. Each time the data changes in a react app, a new virtual DOM gets created. Creating a virtual DOM is much faster than rendering the UI inside the browser. Therefore, with the use of virtual DOM, the efficiency of the app improves. That's why React provides great efficiency.\nCreating dynamic web applications is easy.\nIn React, creating a dynamic web application is much easier. It requires less coding and gives more functionality. It uses JSX (JavaScript Extension), which is a particular syntax letting HTML quotes and HTML tag syntax to render particular subcomponents.\nReact is SEO-friendly.\nReact facilitates a developer to develop an engaging user interface that can be easily navigated in various search engines. It also allows server-side rendering, which is also helpful to boost the SEO of your app.\nReact allows reusable components.\nReact web applications are made up of multiple components where each component has its logic and controls. These components provide a small, reusable piece of HTML code as an output that can be reused wherever you need them. The code reusability helps developers to make their apps easier to develop and maintain. It also makes the nesting of the components easy and allows developers to build complex applications of simple building blocks. The reuse of components also increases the pace of development.\nSupport of handy tools\nReact provides a lot of handy tools that can make the task of the developers understandable and easier. Use these tools in Chrome and Firefox dev extension, allowing us to inspect the React component hierarchies in the virtual DOM. It also allows us to select the particular components and examine and edit their current props and state.\nReact has a rich set of libraries.\nReact has a huge ecosystem of libraries and provides you the freedom to choose the tools, libraries, and architecture for developing the best application based on your requirement.\n\nScope for testing the codes\nReact web applications are easy to test. These applications provide a scope where the developer can test and debug their codes with the help of native tools.\nFor More Information, Click here.",

        "question": "4) What are the biggest limitations of React?",
        "answer": "Following is the list of the biggest limitations of React:\nReact is just a library. It is not a complete framework.\nIt has a huge library which takes time to understand.\nIt may be difficult for the new programmers to understand and code.\nReact uses inline templating and JSX, which may be difficult and act as a barrier. It also makes the coding complex.",

    {
        "question": "5) What is JSX?",
        "answer": "JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a React extension which allows writing JavaScript code that looks similar to HTML. It makes HTML file easy to understand. The JSX file makes the React application robust and boosts its performance. JSX provides you to write XML-like syntax in the same file where you write JavaScript code, and then preprocessor (i.e., transpilers like Babel) transform these expressions into actual JavaScript code. Just like XML/HTML, JSX tags have a tag name, attributes, and children.\nExample\nclass App extends React.Component {  \n  render() {  \n    return(  \n      <div>  \n        <h1>Hello JavaTpoint</h1>  \n      </div>  \n    )  \n  }  \n}  \n\nIn the above example, text inside <h1> tag return as JavaScript function to the render function. After compilation, the JSX expression becomes a normal JavaScript function, as shown below.\nReact.createElement(\"h1\", null, \"Hello JavaTpoint\");  \nFor More Information, Click here.",

    {
        "question": "6) Why can't browsers read JSX?",
        "answer": "Browsers cannot read JSX directly because they can only understand JavaScript objects, and JSX is not a regular JavaScript object. Thus, we need to transform the JSX file into a JavaScript object using transpilers like Babel and then pass it to the browser.",
        "reference": "javatpoint.com"
    },
    {
        "question": "7) Why we use JSX?",
        "answer": "It is faster than regular JavaScript because it performs optimization while translating the code to JavaScript.\nInstead of separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React uses components that contain both.\nt is type-safe, and most of the errors can be found at compilation time.\nIt makes easier to create templates.",
        "reference": "javatpoint.com"
    },
    {
        "question": "8) What do you understand by Virtual DOM?",
        "answer": "A Virtual DOM is a lightweight JavaScript object which is an in-memory representation of real DOM. It is an intermediary step between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen. It is similar to a node tree which lists the elements, their attributes, and content as objects and their properties. The render function creates a node tree of the React components and then updates this node tree in response to the mutations in the data model caused by various actions done by the user or by the system.",

    },
    {
        "question": "",
        "answer": "Virtual DOM works in three steps:\n1. Whenever any data changes in the React App, the entire UI is re-rendered in Virtual DOM representation.\n\n2.

        "answer": "The different phases of React component's lifecycle are:\nInitial Phase: It is the birth phase of the React lifecycle when the component starts its journey on a way to the DOM. In this phase, a component contains the default Props and initial State. These default properties are done in the constructor of a component.\nMounting Phase: In this phase, the instance of a component is created and added into the DOM.\nUpdating Phase: It is the next phase of the React lifecycle. In this phase, we get new Props and change State. This phase can potentially update and re-render only when a prop or state change occurs. The main aim of this phase is to ensure that the component is displaying the latest version of itself. This phase repeats again and again.\nUnmounting Phase: It is the final phase of the React lifecycle, where the component instance is destroyed and unmounted(removed) from the DOM.\nFor More Information, Click here.",

It is executed before the creation of the component.\ncomponentWillMount(): It is executed before a component gets rendered into the DOM.\ncomponentDidMount(): It is executed when the component gets rendered and placed on the DOM. Now, you can do any DOM querying operations.\ncomponentWillReceiveProps(): It is invoked when a component receives new props from the parent class and before another render is called. If you want to update the State in response to prop changes, you should compare this.props and nextProps to perform State transition by using this.setState() method.\nshouldComponentUpdate(): It is invoked when a component decides any changes/updation to the DOM and returns true or false value based on certain conditions. If this method returns true, the component will update. Otherwise, the component will skip the updating.\ncomponentWillUpdate(): It is invoked before rendering takes place in the DOM. Here, you can't change the component State by invoking this.setState() method. It will not be called, if shouldComponentUpdate() returns false.\ncomponentDidUpdate(): It is invoked immediately after rendering takes place. In this method, you can put any code inside this which you want to execute once the updating occurs.\ncomponentWillUnmount(): It is invoked immediately before a component is destroyed and unmounted permanently. It is used to clear up the memory spaces such as invalidating timers, event listener, canceling network requests, or cleaning up DOM elements.

It can contain state and props and has access to the React lifecycle methods.\n3. It is immutable. It is mutable.\n4. We cannot apply any methods on elements. We can apply methods on components.\n5. Example:\nconst element = React.createElement(\n'div',\n{id: 'login-btn'},\n'Login'\n)\nExample:\nfunction Button ({ onLogin }) {\nreturn React.createElement(\n'div',\n{id: 'login-btn', onClick: onLogin},\n'Login'\n)\n}",

It is used to define multiple routes in the app. When a user types a specific URL into the browser, and if this URL path matches any 'route' inside the router file, the user will be redirected to that particular Route. So, we need to add a Router library to the React app, which allows creating multiple routes with each leading to us a unique view.\n<switch>  \n      <h1>React Router Example</h1>  \n      <Route path=\"/\" component={Home} />  \n      <Route path=\"/about\" component={About} />  \n      <Route path=\"/contact\" component={Contact} />  \n</switch>",

        "question": "66) What is an error boundary or error boundaries?",
        "answer": "An error boundary is a concept introduced in version 16 of React. Error boundaries provide a way to find out the errors that occur in the render phase. Any component which uses one of the following lifecycle methods is considered an error boundary. Let's see the places where an error boundary can detect an error:\nRender phase\nInside a lifecycle method\nInside the constructor\nLet's see an example to understand it better:\nWithout using error boundaries:\nclass CounterComponent extends React.Component{  \n constructor(props){  \n   super(props);  \n   this.state = {  \n     counterValue: 0  \n   }  \n   this.incrementCounter = this.incrementCounter.bind(this);  \n }  \n incrementCounter(){  \n   this.setState(prevState => counterValue = prevState+1);  \n }  \n render(){  \n   if(this.state.counter === 2){  \n     throw new Error('Crashed');  \n   }  \n   return(  \n     <div>  \n       <button onClick={this.incrementCounter}>Increment Value</button>  \n       <p>Value of counter: {this.state.counterValue}</p>  \n     </div>  \n   )  \n }  \n}  \nIn the above code, you can see that when the counterValue equals 2, it throws an error inside the render method. We know that any error inside the render method leads to unmounting of the component so, to display an error that occurs inside the render method, we use error boundaries. When we are not using the error boundary, we see a blank page instead of seeing an error.\nWith error boundaries:\nWe have specified earlier that error boundary is a component using one or both of the following methods:\nstatic getDerivedStateFromError\ncomponentDidCatch\nSee the following code where we create an error boundary to handle errors in render phase:\nclass ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {  \n constructor(props) {  \n   super(props);  \n   this.state = { hasError: false };  \n }  \n static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {       \n   return { hasError: true };   \n }  \n  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {         \n   logErrorToMyService(error, errorInfo);   \n }  \n render() {  \n   if (this.state.hasError) {       \n     return <h4>Something went wrong</h4>       \n   }  \n   return this.props.children;  \n }  \n}  \nYou can see in the above code the getDerivedStateFromError function renders the fallback UI interface when the render method has an error.\nThe componentDidCatch logs the error information to an error tracking service.\nNow with error boundary, we can render the CounterComponent in the following way:\n<ErrorBoundary>  \n  <CounterComponent/>  \n</ErrorBoundary>",

It allows React components to read data from a Redux Store, and dispatch Actions to the Store to update data. Redux helps apps to scale by providing a sensible way to manage state through a unidirectional data flow model. React Redux is conceptually simple.

The single State tree makes it easier to keep changes over time. It also makes it easier to debug or inspect the application.\nThe State is read-only: There is only one way to change the State is to emit an action, an object describing what happened. This principle ensures that neither the views nor the network callbacks can write directly to the State.\nChanges are made with pure functions: To specify how actions transform the state tree, you need to write reducers (pure functions).
