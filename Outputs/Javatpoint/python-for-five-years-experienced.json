Type is the typical metaclass in Python. If you're pondering, type is itself a class, and it is its kind. You will not have the option to reproduce something like sort simply in Python, yet Python swindles a bit. To make your metaclass in Python, you simply need to subclass type.\nA metaclass is most ordinarily utilized as a class plant. Like you make an occasion of the class by calling the class, Python makes another class (when it executes the 'class' articulation) by calling the metaclass. Joined with the typical __init__ and __new__ techniques, metaclasses subsequently permit you to do 'additional things' while making a class, such as enlisting the new class with some library or even supplanting the class with something different.\nWhen the class explanation is executed, Python initially executes the body of the class proclamation as a typical block of code.
