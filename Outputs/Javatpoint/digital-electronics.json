        "question": "1) What is the difference between Latch And Flip-flop?",
        "answer": "The difference between latches and Flip-flop is that the latches are level triggered and flip-flops are edge triggered. In latches level triggered means that the output of the latches changes as we change the input and edge triggered means that control signal only changes its state when goes from low to high or high to low.\nLatches are fast whereas flip-flop is slow.",
