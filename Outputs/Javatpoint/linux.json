        "answer": "Linux is a UNIX based operating system. Linus Torvalds first introduced it. It is an open source operating system that was designed to provide free and a low-cost operating system for the computer users.\nLinux is an open-source Unix-like computer OS that directly manages the resources and hardware of a system, like storage, memory, and CPU, and handles the communication between hardware and software. First, it was published on 5 October 1991 by Linus Torvalds for systems and is considered faster and more secure than Windows. It's freely distributable and is basically established around Linux Kernel. Additionally, it can be installed in notebooks, computers, laptops, mobiles, etc. Linux operating system flavors include Gentoo, SUSE Linux, Debian, Ubuntu, etc.\nSome important aspects of the Linux operating system include:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nAdaptable and robust: Linux can work for prolonged times without crushing and is very much resistant to security threats.\nOpen-source and free: it is easily and freely available to everyone.\nMore secure: Linux is more secure because it offers security with authentication features, such as file system access control, security auditing, and password authentication.\nMultiprogramming system: Multiple functions or an application can simultaneously run.\nApplication support: Linux includes its software repository, which is a storage location or place from where software can be redeemed so that users can get applications.\nGraphical user interface: Linux offers an interface for users to collaborate with the system and permits to use of graphical user interface applications, like Firefox, VLC, etc.\nCustomized keywords: There are several different languages used across the world. Hence, Linux supports multiple language keyboard installation.",

It is used for implementing the functionality of the operating system.\nSystem utility: System utilities are utility programs that are liable to perform individual-level and specialized tasks. These are considered more responsible and permit users to handle the system.\nHardware: It's physical hardware that contains items like a CPU, display, keyboard, mouse, etc.\nShell: It's an environment where we can execute our commands, programs, and shell scripts.
