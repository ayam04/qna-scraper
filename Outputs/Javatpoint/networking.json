        "question": "2) What do you mean by network topology?",
        "answer": "Network topology specifies the layout of a computer network. It shows how devices and cables are connected to each other. The types of topologies are:\nBus:\n\nBus topology is a network topology in which all the nodes are connected to a single cable known as a central cable or bus.\nIt acts as a shared communication medium, i.e., if any device wants to send the data to other devices, then it will send the data over the bus which in turn sends the data to all the attached devices.\nBus topology is useful for a small number of devices. As if the bus is damaged then the whole network fails.\nStar:\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nStar topology is a network topology in which all the nodes are connected to a single device known as a central device.\nStar topology requires more cable compared to other topologies. Therefore, it is more robust as a failure in one cable will only disconnect a specific computer connected to this cable.\nIf the central device is damaged, then the whole network fails.\nStar topology is very easy to install, manage and troubleshoot.\nStar topology is commonly used in office and home networks.\nRing\n\n\nRing topology is a network topology in which nodes are exactly connected to two or more nodes and thus, forming a single continuous path for the transmission.\nIt does not need any central server to control the connectivity among the nodes.\nIf the single node is damaged, then the whole network fails.\nRing topology is very rarely used as it is expensive, difficult to install and manage.\nExamples of Ring topology are SONET network, SDH network, etc.\nMesh\n\n\n\nMesh topology is a network topology in which all the nodes are individually connected to other nodes.\nIt does not need any central switch or hub to control the connectivity among the nodes.\nMesh topology is categorized into two parts:\nFully connected mesh topology: In this topology, all the nodes are connected to each other.\nPartially connected mesh topology: In this topology, all the nodes are not connected to each other.\nIt is a robust as a failure in one cable will only disconnect the specified computer connected to this cable.\nMesh topology is rarely used as installation and configuration are difficult when connectivity gets more.\nCabling cost is high as it requires bulk wiring.\nTree\n\n\nTree topology is a combination of star and bus topology. It is also known as the expanded star topology.\nIn tree topology, all the star networks are connected to a single bus.\nEthernet protocol is used in this topology.\nIn this, the whole network is divided into segments known as star networks which can be easily maintained. If one segment is damaged, but there is no effect on other segments.\nTree topology depends on the \"main bus,\" and if it breaks, then the whole network gets damaged.\nHybrid\nA hybrid topology is a combination of different topologies to form a resulting topology.\nIf star topology is connected with another star topology, then it remains star topology. If star topology is connected with different topology, then it becomes a Hybrid topology.\nIt provides flexibility as it can be implemented in a different network environment.\nThe weakness of a topology is ignored, and only strength will be taken into consideration.",

        "answer": "OSI reference model: OSI reference model is an ISO standard which defines a networking framework for implementing the protocols in seven layers. These seven layers can be grouped into three categories:\nNetwork layer: Layer 1, Layer 2 and layer 3 are the network layers.\nTransport layer: Layer 4 is a transport layer.\nApplication layer. Layer 5, Layer 6 and Layer 7 are the application layers.\nThere are 7 layers in the OSI reference model.\n1. Physical Layer\nIt is the lowest layer of the OSI reference model.\nIt is used for the transmission of an unstructured raw bit stream over a physical medium.\nPhysical layer transmits the data either in the form of electrical/optical or mechanical form.\nThe physical layer is mainly used for the physical connection between the devices, and such physical connection can be made by using twisted-pair cable, fibre-optic or wireless transmission media.\n2. DataLink Layer\nIt is used for transferring the data from one node to another node.\nIt receives the data from the network layer and converts the data into data frames and then attach the physical address to these frames which are sent to the physical layer.\nIt enables the error-free transfer of data from one node to another node.\nFunctions of Data-link layer:\n\nFrame synchronization: Data-link layer converts the data into frames, and it ensures that the destination must recognize the starting and ending of each frame.\nFlow control: Data-link layer controls the data flow within the network.\nError control: It detects and corrects the error occurred during the transmission from source to destination.\nAddressing: Data-link layer attach the physical address with the data frames so that the individual machines can be easily identified.\nLink management: Data-link layer manages the initiation, maintenance and, termination of the link between the source and destination for the effective exchange of data.\n3. Network Layer\nNetwork layer converts the logical address into the physical address.\nIt provides the routing concept means it determines the best route for the packet to travel from source to the destination.\nFunctions of network layer:\n\nRouting: The network layer determines the best route from source to destination. This function is known as routing.\nLogical addressing: The network layer defines the addressing scheme to identify each device uniquely.\nPacketizing: The network layer receives the data from the upper layer and converts the data into packets. This process is known as packetizing.\nInternetworking: The network layer provides the logical connection between the different types of networks for forming a bigger network.\nFragmentation: It is a process of dividing the packets into the fragments.\n4. Transport Layer\nIt delivers the message through the network and provides error checking so that no error occurs during the transfer of data.\nIt provides two kinds of services:\nConnection-oriented transmission: In this transmission, the receiver sends the acknowledgement to the sender after the packet has been received.\nConnectionless transmission: In this transmission, the receiver does not send the acknowledgement to the sender.\n5. Session Layer\nThe main responsibility of the session layer is beginning, maintaining and ending the communication between the devices.\nSession layer also reports the error coming from the upper layers.\nSession layer establishes and maintains the session between the two users.\n6. Presentation Layer\nThe presentation layer is also known as a Translation layer as it translates the data from one format to another format.\nAt the sender side, this layer translates the data format used by the application layer to the common format and at the receiver side, this layer translates the common format into a format used by the application layer.\nFunctions of presentation layer:\nCharacter code translation\nData conversion\nData compression\nData encryption\n7. Application Layer\nApplication layer enables the user to access the network.\nIt is the topmost layer of the OSI reference model.\nApplication layer protocols are file transfer protocol, simple mail transfer protocol, domain name system, etc.\nThe most widely used application protocol is HTTP(Hypertext transfer protocol ). A user sends the request for the web page using HTTP.",
