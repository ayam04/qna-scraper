Kubernetes is more complicated than Docker Swarm to set up, but it assures a robust cluster.\nDocker Swarm can't do auto-scaling as the Kubernetes can do, but Docker's scaling is five times faster than Kubernetes. Kubernetes can do auto-scaling, but scaling is slower than Docker Swarm.\nDocker Swarm doesn't provide a GUI. Kubernetes provides a GUI in the form of a dashboard.\nDocker Swarm provides an automatic load balancing feature of traffic between containers in a cluster. It requires manual intervention in Kubernetes for load balancing such traffic.\nDocker requires third-party tools such as the ELK stack for logging and monitoring. Kubernetes provides such integrated tools for logging and monitoring purposes.\nIn Docker Swarm, we can easily share storage volumes with any container. In Kubernetes, we can only share storage volumes with containers in the same pod.\nWe can deploy rolling updates in Docker Swarm but can't deploy automatic rollbacks.
