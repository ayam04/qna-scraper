        "answer": "Teradata is an RDBMS (Relational database management system) which is perfect to use with large-scale data warehousing application. It works on the parallelism concept. It is an open system. It can run on Windows/ UNIX/ Linux server platform. Teradata provides support to multiple data warehouse operations at the same time to different clients.\nIt is developed by an American IT firm called Teradata corporation. It is a dealer of analytic data platforms, applications, and other related services.\nCharacteristics of Teradata\nADVERTISEMENT\nIt is compatible with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).\nIt acts in a way as a server does.\nIt is an open system.\nIt is single.\nIt has multi-node running capabilities.\nIt is built on parallelism.",

        "question": "2) What are the different table types supported by Teradata?",
        "answer": "There are four types of tables as per data storage in Teradata:\nPermanent table\nGlobal Temporary Table (GTT)\nVolatile table\nDerived table\nPermanent Table\nThese are the Default table types in Teradata. Some of its characteristics are as follows.\nAs its name suggests these tables remains in the system until it is dropped.\nData is stored in a stable space.\nThe permanent table definition is stored in the data dictionary.\nGlobal Temporary Tables\nGlobal Temporary tables are also another kind of permanent tables. These tables are used to store the globally used values throughout the application, and the lifetime is limited to the user session. Once the user session is over, the table will be dropped.\nThe global temporary table definition is stored in the data dictionary\nData is stored in temporary space\nCollect statistics supported.\nVolatile Tables\nVolatile tables are used to store the user session data only. At the end of a particular user session, the table will drop. Volatile tables are essential to store in-between data during data transmission or in complex calculations.\nDerived Tables\nDerived tables have the smallest lifetime among all the tables. These tables hold the intermediate results during the query execution. These tables are created, used and dropped within a query.",

        "question": "3) What is the difference between Teradata and Oracle?",
        "answer": "The Teradata and Oracle both are the Relational database management systems. However, Oracle supports an Object-Relational Database Management System (ORDBMS).\nLet's check out some differences between Teradata and Oracle based on the following parameters.\nArchitecture\nOracle is Shared Everything Architecture whereas Teradata is Shared Nothing (SN) Architecture.\nHere the term Shared architecture is referred to a multiprocessor database management system where memory and disk storage is shared between the processors.\nParallelism\nOracle has conditional parallelism whereas Teradata has unconditional parallelism. It gives Teradata advantage over OLAP, which results in the exceptional performance than a non-parallel system. Parallelism needs a multi-processor system.\nScalability\nScalability contains several aspects of an IT infrastructure such as data handling ( Increases in Data and transactional volume) as well as the increase in multidimensional data, number of users, query complexity, etc.\n\nTeradata is Linearly Scalable. Linearly scalable means the database capacity can be increased by adding more nodes to the infrastructure, and when the data volume increases, performance is not affected.",

So the result code running in one system may affect the memory used by another.\nSMP databases usually use one CPU to perform database searches.\nThe workload for a parallel task is allocated across the processors in the system.\nSMP databases can run on several servers.
