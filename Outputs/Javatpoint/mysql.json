        "question": "1) What is MySQL?",
        "answer": "MySQL is a multithreaded, multi-user SQL database management system which has more than 11 million installations. It is the world's second most popular and widely-used open source database. It is interesting how MySQL name was given to this query language. The term My is coined by the name of the daughter of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, and SQL is the short form of Structured Query Language. Using MySQL is free of cost for the developer, but enterprises have to pay a license fee to Oracle.\nFormerly MySQL was initially owned by a for-profit firm MySQL AB, then Sun Microsystems bought it, and then Oracle bought Sun Microsystems, so Oracle currently owns MySQL.\nMySQL is an Oracle-supported Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) based on structured query language. MySQL supports a wide range of operating systems, most famous of those include Windows, Linux & UNIX. Although it is possible to develop a wide range of applications with MySQL, it is only used for web applications & online publishing. It is a fundamental part of an open-source enterprise known as Lamp.\nWhat is the Lamp?\nThe Lamp is a platform used for web development. The Lamp uses Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP as an operating system, web server, database & object-oriented scripting language. And hence abbreviated as LAMP.",

The differences are as follows:\nTables are a way to represent the division of data in a database while the database is a collection of tables and data.\nTables are used to group the data in relation to each other and create a dataset. This dataset will be used in the database. The data stored in the table in any form is a part of the database, but the reverse is not true.\nA database is a collection of organized data and features used to access them, whereas the table is a collection of rows and columns used to store the data.",

Using SQL Join Clause\nThis approach is similar to the way we join two tables. The following query returns result from three tables:\nSELECT name, scores, address, email FROM Student s   \nINNER JOIN Marks m on s.stud_id = m.stud_id   \nINNER JOIN Details d on d.school_id = m.school_id;  \n2. Using Parent-Child Relationship\nIt is another approach to join more than two tables. In the above tables, we have to create a parent-child relationship. First, create column X as a primary key in one table and as a foreign key in another table. Therefore, stud_id is the primary key in the Student table and will be a foreign key in the Marks table. Next, school_id is the primary key in the Marks table and will be a foreign key in the Details table. The following query returns result from three tables:\nSELECT name, scores, address, email   \nFROM Student s, Marks m, Details d   \nWHERE s.stud_id = m.stud_id AND m.school_id = d.school_id;  \nTo read more information about the foreign key, click here.",
