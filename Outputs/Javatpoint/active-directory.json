        "answer": "The term active directory specifies an index structure or MetaData used in Microsoft Windows-based servers and computers to stock up data and information about domains and networks.\nActive Directory is like a database that stores data such as user information, computer information, and other network object information.

        "question": "2) What is a domain?",
        "answer": "A domain is a set of network resources for a group of users. The users need only to log in to the domain to access the resources, which may be located on different servers in the network. The 'domain' specifies a system address that may provide you a lot of information. A domain address might look something like 211.170.469. The concept of the domain was introduced in Windows NT, where a user may grant access to several computer resources using a single username and password combination.",

        "answer": "Three main components are used to make an AD Schema:\nADVERTISEMENT\nObjects: Objects are the entities that Active Directory uses to store information about the resources in its network. In Active Directory, objects are used as references to the resources in the network. For example, if a computer belongs to the Active Directory network, there would be a computer object that will represent this computer in real life. The computer object will also store some information about the computer such as operating system, running status, etc.\nClasses: In an Active Directory Schema, attributes are grouped and categorized into object classes. Object classes are, therefore, hierarchical classifications of object definitions. There are three types of classes in an Active Directory schema:\nAbstract class\nStructural class\nAuxiliary class\nAttributes: Attributes are the entities that are used to store information about the objects in the Active Directory environment. For example, a user object can have attributes such as their first name, last name, telephone number, address, and other attributes that store data about the user. Some attributes also store information about other attributes than the object itself. There are several types of attributes, such as linked attributes, indexed attributes, and global attributes.",

For example, jobs.career.com and career.com both domains are a part of the career.com domain tree. If the domain you create does not contain the full name of the parent domain or forest root domain, it is considered part of a separate domain tree.\nA forest is a collection of one or more domain trees. The domains in the career.com domain tree and the colleges.com domain tree could be part of the same forest. A domain tree is based on a common namespace, but a forest is not. A forest is named after the first domain created in the forest. Suppose career.com is the first domain created, then the forest is automatically named career.com. Later, you can create additional domains for jobs.career.com and colleges.com, all belonging to the career.com forest.",
