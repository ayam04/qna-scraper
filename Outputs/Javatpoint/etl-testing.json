To choose the ETL tool for a specific project is a very strategic move, even we need it for a small project.\nHere are some points which will help us to choose the ETL tool.\nData Connectivity\nTo choose the ETL tool, we will focus on how the ETL tool should communicate with any source of data no matter where the data comes. Data connectivity is very critical.\nPerformance\nTo move and change the data requires some serious processing power. So here, we need to check the performance factor.\nTransformation Flexibility\nMerging, Matching, and Changing the data is very critical. ETL tools should provide all these Mergings, Matching and Changing operations and many transformation packages. It allows the modification to the data in the transformation phase with simple drag and drop.\nData Quality\nWe can take advantage of the data only when the data is clean and consistent.\nFlexible data action option\nWhen the ETL is ready, we need to check that ETL will work on previous data as well as new coming data.\nCommitted ETL vendor\nWe are working with the organization data while we are doing the ETL process.
