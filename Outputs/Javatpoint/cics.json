The POS parameter is used to indicate the row and column position in the field relative to the upper left corner of the map position.\nATTRB: ATTRB is the short form for the field attribute. Generally, the BMS field attribute is not required because the BMS always uses the default value of the auto-skip protection, normal intensity, and the modified tag.\nLength: The length is used to specify the characters present in the field. In the length type, the attribute bytes are not present, so each of the lengths occupies one more column compared to its length value.\nInitial: The initial type is also not required in the BMS. It is only used in the label and the title field that already has a constant value in the BMS.\nPicout: The picout is one of the definitions of the filed CHG and is used to tell the BMS what types of pictures are mainly used to generate the fields. The Picout is also used to edit the facilities of the COBOL or the PL/I when data is moved into the map.\nGRPNAME and OCCURS: GRPNAME and OCCURS options are one of the most complex forms.

If you modify the field on the screen, then MDT acts as a bit of an attribute byte.\nFRSET stands for Flag Reset. It is used to reset MDT and turns off the modified data tag in the attribute bytes for all the fields on the screen. If it once set on, whether by the user or the program, a modified data tag stays on until turned off explicitly, even over several screen transmissions. On the other hand, FSET turns on the modified data tag. On the other hand, FSET turns on the modified data tag. It is used to ensure that MDT transmits the field. FSET is used during an output operation. If you don't specify this, the field is sent only if the user changes it.",

        "question": "63) How can you classify a CICS program?",

        "question": "64) What do you understand by the term conversational programs?",
        "answer": "The conversational programs are the programs that require user intervention to complete the execution. In other words, we can say that the program that requires input from the user and displays the data on the screen after processing is called a conversational program.\nThe conversational programs are mainly used to send a message to the terminals and receive a response from the active users. For example, online applications always use the conversation between the users and the application program by using the send and receive command.",

        "question": "65) What do you understand by the term non-conversational programs?",
        "answer": "The non-conversational programs are the programs that don't require any user intervention for execution. All the required inputs are available to the program when we start the execution. In other words, we can say that the programs used for displaying the reports or messages are called non-conversational programs.\nThe non-conventional programs are very similar to the batch program and run in batch mode. These programs are mainly used to display a sequence on the screen at the regular interval of time.",

        "question": "66) What do you understand by the term pseudo-conversational programs?",
        "answer": "The pseudo-conversational programs respond to user actions or events. It is a subtype of the conversational program which only runs when it is started or called by another program. It also needs certain actions of the users like hit enter etc. It is also called an event-based program.",

        "question": "67) What are the key differences between TSQ and TDQ in CICS?",
        "answer": "Following is a list of key differences between TSQ and TDQ in CICS:\nTSQ TDQ\nTSQ is an acronym that stands for Temporary Storage Queues. TDQ is an acronym that stands for Transient Data Queues.\nData within the temporary storage queue (TSQ) can be changed. Data within the transient data queues (TDQ) cannot be changed.\nWe can read the data more than once in a temporary storage queue, and the records can be read randomly. We can read the data only once in the transient data queue, and the records can be read only sequentially.\nWe can update an existing record in a TSQ. We cannot update an existing record in a TDQ.\nWe cannot access TSQ in batch. We can easily use TDQ in batch applications.\nThe names of TSQ are dynamically defined in the application program. We have to define the name of TDQ in the DCT (Destination Control Table).\nTSQ cannot start a CICS transaction automatically. TDQ can start a CICS transaction automatically.",
