        "answer": "Flutter is a UI toolkit for creating fast, beautiful, natively compiled mobile applications with one programming language and a single codebase. It is an open-source development framework developed by Google. Generally, Flutter is not a language; it is an SDK. Flutter apps use Dart programming language for creating an app. The first alpha version of Flutter was released in May 2017.\nFlutter is mainly optimized for 2D mobile apps that can run on both Android and iOS platforms. We can also use it to build full-featured apps, including camera, storage, geolocation, network, third-party SDKs, and more.\nTo read more information, click here.",

        "question": "5) What are the Flutter widgets?",
        "answer": "A Flutter app is always considered as a tree of widgets. Whenever you are going to code for building anything in Flutter, it will be inside a widget. Widgets describe how your app view should look like with their current configuration and state. When you made any alteration in the code, the widget rebuilt its description by calculating the difference of previous and current widget to determine the minimal changes for rendering in the app's UI.\nWidgets are nested with each other to build the app. It means your app's root is itself a widget, and all the way down is a widget also. For example, a widget can display something, can define design, can handle interaction, etc.\nTo read more information, click here.",

        "question": "6) What do you understand by the Stateful and Stateless widgets?",
        "answer": "A Stateful widget has state information. It is referred to as dynamic because it can change the inner data during the widget lifetime. A widget that allows us to refresh the screen is called a Stateful widget. This widget does not have a build() method. It has createState() method, which returns a class that extends the Flutters State Class. The examples of the Stateful widget are Checkbox, Radio, Slider, InkWell, Form, and TextField.\nThe Stateless widget does not have any state information. It remains static throughout its lifecycle. The examples of the Stateless widget are Text, Row, Column, Container, etc. If the screen or widget contains static content, it should be a Stateless widget, but if you want to change the content, it needs to be a Stateful widget.",

        "question": "9) What are packages and plugins in Flutter?",
        "answer": "A package is a group of similar types of classes, interfaces, and sub-packages. The packages and plugins help us to build the app without having to develop everything from packages. In Flutter, it allows you to import new widgets or functionality into the app. The packages and plugins have a very small distinction. Generally, packages are the new components or the code written in dart languages, whereas plugins allow more functionality on the device by using the native code. In the DartPub, packages and plugins are both referred to as packages.\nTo read more information, click here.",

        "question": "10) What are the advantages of Flutter?",
        "answer": "The popular advantages of the Flutter framework are as follows:\nCross-platform Development: This feature allows Flutter to write the code once, maintain, and can run on different platforms. It saves the time, effort, and money of the developers.\nFaster Development: The performance of the Flutter application is fast. Flutter compiles the application by using the arm C/C++ library that makes it closer to machine code and gives the app a better native performance.\nGood Community: Flutter has good community support where the developers can ask the issues and get the result quickly.\nLive and Hot Reloading: It makes the app development process extremely fast. This feature allows us to change or update the code are reflected as soon as the alterations are made.\nMinimal code: Flutter app is developed by Dart programming language, which uses JIT and AOT compilation to improve the overall start-up time, functioning and accelerates the performance. JIT enhances the development system and refreshes the UI without putting extra effort into building a new one.\nUI Focused: It has an excellent user interface because it uses a design-centric widget, high-development tools, advanced APIs, and many more features.\nDocumentation: Flutter has very good documentation support. It is organized and more informative. We can get everything that we want to be written in one place.\nTo read more information, click here.",

It mainly works with States value.\nThe hot reload feature allows us to quickly compile the newly added code in the file and sent them to Dart Virtual Machine (DVM). After DVM completes the updation, it immediately updates the UI of the app. It allows developers to get a fully compiled application because it destroys the preserves State values and sets them to their defaults. On every Hot Restart, our app widget tree is completely rebuilt with the new typed code.\nIt helps to build UI, add new features, fix bugs, and make app development fast.

        "question": "26) What is Stream in Flutter?",
        "answer": "A stream is a sequence of asynchronous events. It provides an asynchronous sequence of data. It is the same as a pipe where we put some value on the one end, and if we have a listener on the other end, it will receive that value. We can keep multiple listeners in a stream, and all of those will receive the same value when put in the pipeline.\nWe can process a stream by using the await for or listen() from the Stream API. It has a way to respond to errors. We can create streams in many ways, but they can be used in the same way. See the below example:\nFuture<int> sumStream(Stream<int> stream) async {  \n    var sum = 0;  \n    await for (var value in stream) {  \n      sum = sum + value;  \n    }  \n    return sum;  \n  }",

        "question": "27) Explain the different types of Streams?",
        "answer": "Streams can be of two types, which are:\nSingle subscription streams\nIt is the most common type of stream that contains a sequence of events, which is the parts of a larger whole. It will deliver the events in the correct order and without missing any of them. If any of the events are missing, then the rest of the stream makes no sense. This stream is mainly used to read a file or receive a web request. It will listen once, and if it is listening again, it means missing an initial event. When it starts listening, the data will be fetched and provided in chunks.\nBroadcast streams\nIt is a type of stream used for individual messages that can be handled one at a time without the knowledge of the previous events. It can have multiple listeners to listen simultaneously, and we can listen again after canceling the previous subscription. This mouse events in a browser is a kind of this stream.",

    {
        "question": "28) Why is the build() method on State and not StatefulWidgets?",
        "answer": "The main reason behind this is that the StatefulWidget uses a separate State class without building a method inside its body. It means all fields inside a Widget are immutable and includes all its sub-classes.\nOn the other hand, the StatelessWidget has its build and associated methods inside its body. It is due to the nature of StatelessWidget, which is rendered completely on the screen using the provided info. It also doesn't allow any future changes in its State information.\nThe StatefulWidget allows us to change the State information during the course of the app. Therefore, it is not suitable for storage in a build method to satisfy Widget class conditions where all fields are immutable. This is the main reason to introduce the State class. Here, we only need to override the createState() function to attach the defined State with the StatefulWidget, and then all expected changes happen in a separate class.",
