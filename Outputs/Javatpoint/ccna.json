A switch is a control unit that turns the flow of electricity on or off in a circuit.\nLayer Hubs are used at the physical layer. Switches are used at the data link layer.\nTransmission type Transmission type can be unicast, broadcast or multicast. Initially, the transmission type is broadcast and then is unicast.\nPorts Hub has 4/12 ports. The switch has 24/48 ports.\nTransmission mode Half duplex Half/Full duplex.\nCollisions Collisions occur commonly in a Hub. No collisions occur in a full duplex switch.\nAddress used for data transmission Hub uses MAC address for data transmission. The switch uses a MAC address for data transmission.\nData transmission form Electrical signal is a data transmission form of a hub. A Frame is a data transmission form of a switch.",

Static routes are used when the route selections are limited. Static routes can also be used in those situations where the devices are fewer and no need to change in the route configuration in future.\nDynamic routing: Dynamic routing is a routing technique where protocols automatically update the information of a routing table.",

VLAN facilitates you to create a collision domain by groups other than just physical location while in conventional LAN domains are always tied to physical location.\n\nAdvantage of VLAN:\nBroadcast control: A VLAN (Virtual Area Network) removes the physical layer and, it logically separates the networks within networks creating a smaller broadcast domain. It reduces the size of the broadcast domain, therefore, improving the efficiency of the network.\nSimplified administration: When a computer is moved to another location, but it stays on the same VLAN without any hardware configuration.\nSecurity:\nLAN segmentation: Virtual Area Networks are used to logically separate layer 2 switch networks. Users on different VLAN cannot communicate with each other. Therefore, it's a great way of segmentation and provides security.\nDynamic VLANs: The Dynamic VLAN's are created using the software. The VLAN Management Policy Server (VMPS) is an administrator that dynamically allocates the switch ports based on the information available such as the MAC addresses of the device.\nProtocol-based VLANs: The switch that depends on the protocol based VLANs, then the traffic will be segregated by a particular protocol.",

This cannot be possible in the case of a hub-based network.\nReduced congestion and transmission delay: LAN switching improves the performance of a network as a segmented network consists of fewer hosts per subnetwork and thus, minimizing the local traffic.\nNo single point of failure: LAN switching provides the proper network designing. Therefore, there are fewer chances of network failure.\nAllows full duplex data transmission: LAN switching allows full duplex data transmission, i.e., the data can be transferred in a bidirectional line at the same time.",

There is no central server and central router present in the pure P2P.\nHybrid P2P: Hybrid P2P has a central server that stores the information and responds to the request for that information. Peers are used for hosting the information as a central server does not store the files. Nasper is an example of Hybrid P2P.\nMixed P2P: Mixed P2P is a combination of pure P2P and Hybrid P2P.\n2. Server-based Network\n\n\nIn a server-based network, server act as a base for the network known as a central server.\nThe central server handles multiple tasks such as authenticating users, storing files, managing printers, and running applications such as database and email programs.\nIn case of a server-based network, security is centralized in the system which allows the user to have one login id and password to log on to any computer system.\nServer-based networks are more complex and costly and often requires full- time services for administration.\nIn server-based networks, the majority of traffic occurs between the servers.",

        "answer": "Topology is an arrangement of various elements (links, nodes, etc.) of a computer network in a specific order. These are the different types of topology used in CCNA:\nBus:\n\nBus topology is a network topology in which all the nodes are connected to a single cable known as a central cable or bus.\nIt acts as a shared communication medium, i.e., if any device wants to send the data to other devices, then it will send the data over the bus which in turn sends the data to all the attached devices.\nBus topology is useful for a small number of devices. As if the bus is damaged then the whole network fails.\nStar:\n\nStar topology is a network topology in which all the nodes are connected to a single device known as a central device.\nStar topology requires more cable compared to other topologies. Therefore, it is more robust as a failure in one cable will only disconnect a specific computer connected to this cable.\nIf the central device is damaged, then the whole network fails.\nStar topology is very easy to install, manage and troubleshoot.\nStar topology is commonly used in office and home networks.\nRing:\n\nRing topology is a network topology in which nodes are exactly connected to two or more nodes and thus, forming a single continuous path for the transmission.\nIt does not need any central server to control the connectivity among the nodes.\nIf the single node is damaged, then the whole network fails.\nRing topology is very rarely used as it is expensive, difficult to install and manage.\nExamples of Ring topology are SONET network, SDH network, etc.\nMesh:\n\nMesh topology is a network topology in which all the nodes are individually connected to other nodes.\nIt does not need any central switch or hub to control the connectivity among the nodes.\nMesh topology is categorized into two parts:\nFully connected mesh topology: In this topology, all the nodes are connected to each other.\nPartially connected mesh topology: In this topology, all the nodes are not connected to each other.\nIt is a robust as a failure in one cable will only disconnect the specified computer connected to this cable.\nMesh topology is rarely used as installation and configuration are difficult when connectivity gets more.\nCabling cost is high as it requires bulk wiring.\nTree:\n\nTree topology is a combination of star and bus topology. It is also known as the expanded star topology.\nIn tree topology, all the star networks are connected to a single bus.\nEthernet protocol is used in this topology.\nIn this, the whole network is divided into segments known as star networks which can be easily maintained. If one segment is damaged, but there is no effect on other segments.\nTree topology depends on the \"main bus,\" and if it breaks, then the whole network gets damaged.\nHybrid:\nA hybrid topology is a combination of different topologies to form a resulting topology.\nIf star topology is connected with another star topology, then it remains star topology. If star topology is connected with different topology, then it becomes a Hybrid topology.\nIt provides flexibility as it can be implemented in a different network environment.\nThe weakness of a topology is ignored, and only strength will be taken into consideration.",
