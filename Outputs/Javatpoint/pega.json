        "answer": "Pega is a platform that allows users to reuse rules across case types and applications. It facilitates developers to frequently reuse rules in their systems, ranging from single data pieces to complete processes. Reusing the rules increases the quality of the application that can also draw a positive impact on the development time. The Pega platform divides the rules into classes according to their re-usability inside an application. Each cluster is called a class.\nThere are three different kinds of classes used to make an application:\nWork Class: The work class includes the processes, data items, and user interfaces. These are all part of the work class, which provides the rules that govern how to process a case.\nIntegration Class: The Integration class consists of the rules that specify how the application interacts with other services, such as the integration resources connecting to a customer database or a third-party web server.\nData Class: The data class stores the rules that specify the data objects used in the application, such as a customer data type or order items data type etc.\n\nWhen a rule is added in the App Studio, it automatically selects the proper class. You have to concentrate on what you want the rule to accomplish rather than how to develop it. You can also write the rule in Dev Studio if you need control over the class. The Dev Studio is preferred if you write a rule that you can reuse in another app.",

This SLA is relevant throughout the lifecycle of a case. It starts when a case is opened and is completed when the case is closed. The standard property pySLAName is used to identify this SLA under the work page, and it is set in pyWorkPage's pxUrgencyWorkSLA parameter. The pxUrgencyWorkSLA property under pyWorkPage is used to control the urgency of case-level SLAs.\nStage Level SLA: The Stage Level SLA is an SLA that is referred to at the stage level. It starts when a case enters a stage and ends when it exits the stage. The pxUrgencyWorkStageSLA property under pyWorkPage is used to control the urgency at the Stage level.\nStep level/Flow level SLA: An SLA is called a Step level or Flow level SLA when referred to as a step or flow level. A step-level SLA starts when a process or step is initiated and ends when it is completed. A flow level SLA is started when a flow is begun and stopped when a flow is stopped. If a step SLA is present, it takes precedence over a flow SLA. Step SLA can be referenced in every step under the stage in the case type rule. The process tab of the flow rule refers to a flow SLA. The pxUrgencyWorkStepSLA property under pyWorkpage controls the flow or step level urgency.",

DCO includes the processes and tools used for gathering and organizing application artefacts. This technology is used by IT, business, and testing teams and other resources to save time, effort, and money while also improving the quality of projects and their impact on society.\n\nDCO is not a methodology or a tool. Instead, it is used to centralize data to be used continually across departments at the right time and the right level. DCO also eliminates communication obstacles by providing a centralized repository for linked application artefacts (objectives, requirements, specifications, and implementation rules). All resources have real-time as-built documentation and a single view of the application.\nFollowing are the tools DCO uses to automate the work:\nCase Lifecycle Manager\nNew Application Wizard\nApplication profiler\nDocument generation\nEffort Estimation\nSpecification documents\nBenefits of using DCO in Pega:\n\nDCO is used to enable collaborative teams to model situations that the application's end users must address. The modelling and simulation tools facilitate users to take a critical interim step after documenting the application but before incurring the cost of development to see if the software meets our objectives. When you work out solutions as a part of the software development life cycle, it is a rare chance to get a problem in production.\nOrganizations also use DCO to improve their efforts and use iterative processes. It makes the software development process more visible, allowing teams to learn and improve constantly. DCO technologies give organizations several ways to deliver go-live, increasing their return on investment and allowing them to accomplish their objectives reliably.",

The BROWSER requestor type indicates the characteristics of interactive user connections, such as guest connections, utilizing Internet Explorer or another web browser. Agents employ the BATCH requestor type for background processing. Pega Platform comes with four requestor types for the system name we specify during installation and a reserved requestor type prpc.BROWSER for exceptional cases.\nGenerally, we only require the four requestor types that contain our system name. If we want to modify the system name after installation, we have to go to Designer Studio => System => Settings => System Name to get to a landing page tab where we can make the change. When we change a system's name, new requestor instances are created that correspond to the previous name's instances. If the prior system name did not include all requestor types for some reason, the missing requestors are also produced when the system is renamed.\nFollowing are the different requestor types in Pega:\n\nApplication: The application requestor type is used by listeners and external client systems to access the Pega Platform, such as through a service request (other than JSR-168 requests using Rule-Service-Portlet rules). Requestor IDs that begin with the letter A are used in requestor sessions that use this requestor type instance.\nBatch: The batch requestor type is used by listeners, services, agents, and daemons executing background processing. The requestor ID for requestor sessions using this instance begins with the letter B. All BATCH requestors have access to the PRPC.\nBrowser: The browser requestor type is used for accessing the Pega Platform portal via a web browser via HTTP or HTTPS or from a browser displaying a Pega composite application. The requestor ID for requestor sessions utilizing this instance starts with the letter H.\nPortal: The portal requestor type is used in conjunction with Service Portlet rules for HTTP access as a portlet. The requestor ID for requestor sessions utilizing this instance starts with the letter P.",
