Consolidation data is from different sources.\nProcess Goal Snapshot of business processes which does essential business tasks Multidimensional view of business events of planning and decision making\nQueries and Process scripts Simple quick running queries ran by customers. Complex long-running queries by a scheme to update the aggregate data.\nDatabase Design Normalize small databases. Speed will not be an issue due to the smaller database, and normalization will not degrade performance. This adopts an entity-relationship (ER) model and function-oriented database design. De-normalized large databases. Speed is an issue due to the larger databases, and de-normalizing will improve performance as there will be lesser tables to scan while performing tasks. This adopts star, snowflake, or fact constellation mode of subject-oriented database design.\nBack-up and system administration Regular database back-up and system administration can do the job. Reloading the OLTP data is well treated as a good backup option.\nClick here for more information",

ETL is software that allows the business to develop their disparate records while moving it from place to place, and it doesn't really matter that data is in several forms or formats. The data can come from any source. ETL is powerful enough to manage such data disparities.\nFirst, the extract function reads data from a particular source database and extracts a desired subset of data.\nSecond, the transform function works with the acquired record using rules or lookup tables, or creating a combination with other records to convert it to the desired state.\nFinally, the load function is used to write the resulting information to a target database.\nClick here for more information",

The storage is not in the relational database but in a proprietary plan (one example is PowerOLAP's .olp file). MOLAP products are compatible with Excel, which can make record interactions easy to learn.\nROLAP: ROLAP products approach a relational database by using SQL (structured query language), which is the standard language that is used to describe and manipulate data in an RDBMS. Subsequent processing may occur in the RDBMS or within a middle-tier server, which accepts requests from users, translates them into SQL statements, and passes them on to the RDBMS.",
