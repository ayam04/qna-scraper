        "question": "1) What is WCF?",
        "answer": "WCF stands for Windows Communication Foundation. It is a framework which is used for building, configuring and deploying interoperable distributed services. Using WCF, you can send data as asynchronous messages from one service endpoint to another. A service endpoint can be part of a continuously available service hosted by IIS, or it can be a service hosted in an application. An endpoint can be a client of a service that requests data from a service endpoint. It provides a facility to write more secure, flexible services without any code change. It also provides built-in support for logging. It facilitates you to enable/disable logging using configuration.\nIts code name is \"Indigo\".",

    {
        "question": "2) What are the WCF service endpoints?",
        "answer": "WCF service endpoint has three basic elements: address, binding, and contract.\nAddress: It defines the address of the URL that identifies the location of the service and specifies the location where messages are received. It is specified as a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). The URI schema part names the transport mechanism to use to reach the address, such as HTTP and TCP. The hierarchical part of the URI contains a unique location whose format is dependent on the transport mechanism.\nThe endpoint address enables you to create unique endpoint addresses for each endpoint in service or, under certain conditions, to share an address across endpoints. The following example shows an address using the HTTPS protocol with a non-default port:\nBinding: It defines how the service can be accessed, how an endpoint communicates to the world. It is constructed of a set of components called binding elements that \"stack\" one on top of the other to create the communication infrastructure. At the very least, a binding defines the transport (such as HTTP or TCP) and the encoding being used (such as text or binary). A binding can contain binding elements that specify details like the security mechanisms used to secure messages or the message pattern used by an endpoint.\nContract: It defines what is exposed by the service. Ties together multiple related operations into a single functional unit. The contract can define service-level settings, such as the namespace of the service, a corresponding callback contract, and other such settings. In most cases, the contract is defined by creating an interface in the programming language of your choice and applying the ServiceContractAttribute attribute to the interface. The actual service code results by implementing the interface.\nOperation contract\nAn operation contract defines the parameters and returns type of operation. When creating an interface that defines the service contract, you signify an operation contract by applying the OperationContractAttribute attribute to each method definition that is part of the contract. The operations can be modeled as taking a single message and returning a single message, or as taking a set of types and returning a type. In the latter case, the system will determine the format for the messages that need to be exchanged for that operation.\nMessage contract\nDescribes the format of a message. For example, it declares whether message elements should go in headers versus the body, what level of security should be applied to what elements of the message, and so on.\nFault contract\nCan be associated with a service operation to denote errors that can be returned to the caller. An operation can have zero or more faults associated with it. These errors are SOAP faults that are modeled as exceptions in the programming model.\nData contract\nThe descriptions in metadata of the data type that a service uses. This enables others to interoperate with the service. The data types can be used in any part of a message, for example, as parameters or return types. If the service is using only simple types, there is no need to use data contracts explicitly.",

        "answer": "A list of essential components used in WCF:\nService class\nThe service runtime layer contains the behaviors that occur only during the actual operation of the service, that is, the runtime behaviors of the service. Throttling controls how many messages are processed, which can be varied if the demand for the service grows to a preset limit.\nEndpoint\nWCF Service is a program that exposes a collection of the endpoints. Each Endpoint is a portal for communicating with the world. All the WCF communications are taken place through the endpoint. An endpoint consists of three components.\nHosting Environment\n\nA service must be hosted in some process. A host is an application that controls the lifetime of the service.

Normally authentication and authorization are done using IIS and ASP.NET security configuration and transport layer security. For message layer security, WSE can be used.\nWCF provides a consistent security programming model for any protocol and it supports many of the same capabilities as IIS and WS-* security protocols, additionally, it provides support for claims-based authorization that provides finer-grained control over resources than role-based security. WCF security is consistent regardless of the host that is used to implement WCF service.\nAnother major difference is that ASMX web services use XmlSerializer for serialization while WCF uses DataContractSerializer which is far better in performance than XmlSerializer.",
