        "question": "1) Explain React Native?",
        "answer": "React Native is an open-source JavaScript framework introduced by Facebook. It is used for developing a real, native mobile application for iOS and Android platforms. It uses only JavaScript to build a mobile app. It is like React, which uses native components rather than using web components as building blocks. It is cross-platform, which allows you to write code once and can run on any platform.\nReact Native application is based on React, a JavaScript library developed by Facebook and XML-Esque markup (JSX) for creating the user interface. It targets the mobile platform rather than the browser. It saves your development time as it allows you to build apps by using a single language JavaScript for both Android and iOS platforms.",

        "question": "2) What are the advantages of React Native?",
        "answer": "React Native provides many advantages for building mobile applications. Some of the essential benefits of using React Native are given below:\nADVERTISEMENT\nCross-Platform: It offers the facility to \"Write once and run everywhere.\" It is used to create apps for Android, iOS, and Windows platforms.\nPerformance: The code written in React Native is compiled into native code, which enables it for all operating systems to provide closer native appearance and functions in the same way on all platforms.\nCommunity: React Native provides a large community of passionate developers who are always ready to help us to fix bugs, and issues occur at any instant.\nHot Reloading: Making a few changes in your app's code immediately visible during development. If the business logic is changed, its reflection is live reloaded on screen.\nFaster Development: React Native helps to develop apps fast. It uses a common language to build an app for Android, iOS, and Windows platforms, which gives speedier app deployment, delivery, and quicker time-to-market.\nJavaScript: JavaScript knowledge is used to build native mobile apps.",

It is still in the improvement stage, which can have a negative impact on the apps.\nLearning is tough: React Native cannot learn quickly, especially for a fresher in the app development field.\nIt Lacks the Security Robustness: React Native is an open-source JavaScript framework, which is fragile and creates a gap in the security robustness. When you are creating banking and financial apps where data is highly confidential, experts advise not to choose React Native.\nIt Takes More Time to Initialize: React Native takes a lot of time for initializing the runtime even if you are using the hi-tech gadgets and devices.\nExistence is Uncertain: As Facebook develop this framework, its presence is uncertain since it keeps all the rights to kill off the project anytime. As the popularity of React Native rises, it is unlikely to happen.",

It provides a connection between the container component and a presentation component.\nStyle: It is an essential component in the web or mobile, which makes the application attractive. React Native does not require any special language or syntax for styling. It can style the application using the JavaScript object.\nText: This component displays text in the app. It uses the basic component textInput to take text input from the user.\nScrollView: It is a scrolling container used to host multiple views.

You will need to find libraries or components which is made specifically for React Native. It is very hard to find that there are components available, which support both. But, it should be easy to figure out that the given components are made for React Native or not. Thus, it makes clear that all components are not usable in the React Native.",

        "question": "12) How Virtual DOM works in React Native?",
        "answer": "Virtual DOM is a lightweight JavaScript object, which is an in-memory representation of a real DOM. It is an intermediary step between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen. It is similar to a node tree, which lists the elements, their attributes, and content as objects and their properties. The render function creates a node tree of the React components and then updates this node tree in response to the mutations in the data model caused by various actions done by the user or by the system.\nVirtual DOM works in three steps:\nWhenever any data changes in the React App, the entire UI is re-rendered in Virtual DOM representation.\nNow, the difference between the previous DOM representation and the new DOM is calculated.\nOnce the calculations are completed, the real DOM updated with only those things which are changed.",

It is an immutable object where you cannot apply any methods. The React Component is a function or class that takes inputs and returns a React element. It contains references to its DOM nodes and the instances of the child components.\nFor Example:\n<button className = \"green\"></button>\nFor Example:\nconst SignIn = () => (\n  <div>\n   <p>Sign In</p>\n   <button>Continue</button>\n   <button color='green'>Cancel</button>\n  </div>\n);",

Since we can reuse most of the React Native code between both platforms, but Android and iOS are different systems. Here, we are going to see these differences.\nOperating System\nYou can build applications for both Android and iOS with React Native, but it is not an easy task to check that the app works on both systems if you are working on Windows systems. Windows do not allow to run XCode and its simulator, which is a macOS app. There are other tools available, but they are not official.\nNative elements\nThe elements perform different actions for the React Native and Native apps. React Native apps uses elements from React Native library, whereas Native apps do not use elements of React native libraries.\nSpecific Styles-Shadows\nShadows style is an essential term of differences between iOS and Android while working on cross-platform apps. Android does not support shadow; instead of this, it uses elevation property.\nLinking libraries\nSometimes we want to use third-party libraries in our app. Most of the time, we add it as a dependency, but sometimes it requires manual linking for adding libraries. Linking libraries manually is not an easy task for developers, either web or native applications.

To handle this deferral, we need to call InteractionManager.runAfterInteractions(() => {...}).\nThe InteractionManager is important because React Native has two threads. One is JavaScript UI thread, which handles drawing updates to the screen, and the second thread used for all task, not on the UI thread. Since React Native has only one thread for making UI updates, it can get overloaded and drop frames, especially in navigation screen animations.
