        "question": "1) What is the Mainframe computer?",
        "answer": "A mainframe computer is a combination of many processors and memory (RAM). It works as a CPU for many workstations and terminals connected with it. A mainframe computer is used to perform a huge amount of data operations in petabytes. It can allow thousands of user to process. Its name 'Mainframe' stands for a frame for holding several processors and main memory. Mainframe computer plays a significant role in e-business where thousands of people connect to a server to precede their request in real-time. Similarly, in banking, government, education system mainframe computer plays a valuable role.",

The Mainframe application is tested against the test cases developed using requirements.\nMainframe Testing is generally performed on the deployed code using various data combinations set.\nWhile performing Mainframe testing, the tester only needs the navigations of the CICS screens.\nIf any changes made to the code in programs like COBOL, JCL, etc., then tester does not need the emulator to set up on the machine. The changes can be applied through one terminal emulator will act on others too.\nMainframe manual testing can be classified into two categories.\nBatch Job Testing\nIn batch testing, the testing process consists of executions of batch jobs for the functionality implemented in the current release.\nOnline Testing\nOnline Testing is known as testing of CICS screens, which is similar to testing of the web page.",
