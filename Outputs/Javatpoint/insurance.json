Eventually, it is a loss for the policyholders because they don't fulfill the insurance company's criteria. Some other names of surrender value are surrender cash value or, in the case of annuities, called annuity surrender value.\nFor example, suppose you have paid 15000 rupees (5000 per year x 3) in the initial three years for a sum assured of 1.5 lakh rupees, and you decide to exit the policy before maturity, so the minimum surrender value you can get is 30% of 10000, which is 3000 rupees.",

        "question": "21) What do you understand by Paid Value?",

The policyholder gets the amount at the end of the term. In this case, the insurance company provides an assured amount but is reduced proportionally according to the time when the policyholder has stopped paying the premium.\nThe deduction from the matured amount depends on how soon before the maturity period that person has requested the paid value. In other words, we can say that when a person who has purchased insurance stops paying premiums after a specific duration, the insurance policy remains active but with a lower assured amount. This reduced amount is called paid value or paid-up value.",

In the event of a loss, the payment is made under the policy concerning the insured, and it would go to the third party rather than to the beneficiary of the same.\nIt acts as a guard for the lender to protect it against unpaid loans. For example, suppose you have bought a car on loan and have car insurance. So, if your car would be crashed within the loan's payment duration, the money would go to the bank from where you have taken a car loan rather than your account.",

        "answer": "It depends on the situation. If you are an insurance policyholder and it is not long after you have bought the policy, you can replace the policy with another policy if you see better returns. But if you have purchased that policy long ago and already paid many premiums, then it is not advisable as you will lose all the benefits of the previous policy. Also, the premium will go high as you grow older. Another issue you will see in this case is that the two-year contestability period will also begin again.",

        "question": "25) What would happen if an insurance policyholder fails to make required premium payments? / What happens if a person doesn't pay premium payments?",
        "answer": "Generally, every insurance company provides a grace period of 10-15 days to the insurance policyholders if they fail to pay the premium before the due date. However, if the policyholders don't pay the premium even in the grace period, their policy will lapse. After that duration, if the policyholders want to revive their policy, they would have to pay the due premium and interest charged on the premium since the due date to revive the policy. Different insurance companies have different norms for reviving their lapse policies.\nOn the other hand, if the policyholder paid premium payments for a substantial duration, i.e., generally more than 2-3 years, and then they stop paying the premium, the insurance company will deduct the premium from the accumulated sum. It continues till there is an available fund. After that, the company terminates the policy. This is common practice with permanent life insurance policies.",

Generally, it is a period of 10 to 15 days, but it depends on the insurance company and can vary. During the free look period, the policyholder can decide whether or not to keep the insurance policy. If the policyholders are not satisfied with the benefits or services, they can cancel the contract and receive a full refund.\nSo, it is possible to get a full refund if the policyholder cancels the insurance policy within the free look period.\nNote: Free-look period is available only for life insurance policies.",
