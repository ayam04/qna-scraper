        "answer": "We have many other technologies similar to Web API, but there are several genuine reasons to use Web API.\nFor example:\nADVERTISEMENT\nWeb API provides us the ability to create non-SOAP-based HTTP services.\nWe can easily use it with HTTP verbs for Create, Read, Update and Delete operations.\nIt is very lightweight, and its lightweight architecture makes it ideal for small bandwidth devices such as smartphones.\nIt is based on HTTP and easy to define, expose and consume in a REST-ful way.\nIt provides an ability to select response output in either JSON or XML and support for Open Data (OData) protocol.",

RESTful is an architectural style for creating loosely coupled applications over HTTP. To make API to be RESTful, we have to follow the six constraints given below:\nClient and Server Separation: Clients and Servers are isolated in the RESTful services.\nStateless: REST architecture is based on the HTTP Protocol, and the clients can cache the server response, but no client context would be stored on the server.\nUniform Interface: It is used to allow a limited set of operations defined using the HTTP Verbs. For example, GET, PUT, POST, Delete, etc.\nCacheable: RESTful architecture allows the response to be cached or not. Caching improves performance and scalability.\nCode-On-Demand\nLayered System",
