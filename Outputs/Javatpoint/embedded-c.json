        "question": "3) What are the key differences between C and Embedded C?",
        "answer": "C is a general-purpose, high-level programming language used to design any desktop-based applications. On the other hand, Embedded C is an extension of the C language, and it is used to develop micro-controller based applications. Here, Embedded refers to the hosting computer or microcontroller and not the programming language. Let's see the key differences between C and Embedded C in the following table.\nDifferences between C and Embedded C:\nC language Embedded C\nC is a general-purpose programming language used to design any desktop-based applications. Embedded C is nothing but an extension C programming language, and it is used to develop micro-controller based applications.\nC is a type of high-level programming language. Embedded C is an extension of the C programming language.\nC programming language is the hardware-independent language. Embedded C is a completely hardware-dependent language.\nC is a simple language, and it is easy to read and modify. Embedded C is comparatively tough, and it is not easy to read and modify the Embedded C language.\nThe compilers of the C programming language are OS-dependent. The compilers of Embedded C are OS independent.\nIn the C programming language, the standard compilers are used to compile and execute the program. In Embedded C language, a specific compiler that can generate particular hardware/micro-controller based output is used to compile the code.\nSome popular compilers used to execute a C language program are:\nGCC (GNU Compiler collection)\nBorland Turbo C\nIntel C++ Some popular compilers used to execute an Embedded C language program are:\nKeil compiler\nBiPOM ELECTRONIC\nGreen Hill software\nC programming language has a free format of program coding. In Embedded C language, formatting depends upon the type of microprocessor used in the application.\nBug fixing is easy in a C language program. Bug fixing is complicated in an Embedded C language program.\nC language also supports other various programming languages during application. Embedded C language supports only the required processor of the application and not the programming languages.\nC programming language must require an operating system. Embedded C may or may not require an operating system.\nIn the C programming language, we can give input to the program while it is running. In Embedded C language, we can give only the pre-defined inputs to the running program.\nThe C programming language supports normal optimization. Embedded C supports the high level of optimization.\nC programming language generally uses the resources of a desktop PC like memory, OS, etc. Embedded C language has to use with the limited resources, such as RAM, ROM, I/Os on an embedded processor.\nSome examples of the C Program applications:\nLogical programs\nSystem software programs etc. Some examples of the Embedded C Program applications:\nDVD\nTV\nDigital camera etc.",

        "question": "7) What is the volatile keyword in Embedded C, and what is its usage?",
        "answer": "In Embedded C, the volatile keyword is a type qualifier that prevents the objects from compiler optimization. According to the C standard, we can modify the volatile-qualified type object in ways unknown to the implementation. In other words, we can say that the value of the volatile-qualified object can be changed at any time without making any changes in the code. If the volatile qualifier qualifies an object, the compiler will reload the value from memory each time the program accesses it. Reading the value from memory is the only way to check the unpredictable change of the value.\nThe volatile keyword is mainly used when we have to deal with GPIO, interrupt or flag Register directly. It is also used with a global variable or buffer shared between the threads.",

        "answer": "No. It is not possible to pass any parameter and return a value from the ISR. The ISR returns nothing and does not allow passing any parameter. An ISR is called when a hardware or software event occurs, and the code does not call it. That's why no parameters are passed into an ISR. As the code does not call ISR, there is no calling code to read the returned values of the ISR. That's why an ISR does not return any value.",

        "question": "15) What is a static variable in C? Why do we use a static variable in C?",
        "answer": "Static variables have the property of preserving their value even after they are out of their scope. It means we can initialize static variables only once. Its scope is local, but it lives until the end of the program. The compiler persists with the variable till the end of the program. We can define static variables inside or outside the function. The default value of static variables is zero. The static variables are alive till the execution of the program.\nSyntax for the static variables in C language:\nstatic datatype variable_name = value;  \nA static variable is generally used to count something. For example, the function openBakAccount() calls whenever a new account opens in the bank. Then, to count the total number of opened accounts, we can declare a static variable in the function and increase it on each function call.",

        "answer": "Following is a list of some interesting facts about static variables in C:\nThere are two types of static variables, static int variable and static auto variable. A static int variable remains in memory while the program is running and a normal or auto variable is destroyed when a function call declared is over. For example, we can use a static int variable to count the number of times a function is called, but we cannot use an auto variable for this purpose.\nStatic variables are allocated memory in the data segment, not the stack segment.\nThe default value for static variables is 0. Like global variables, they are initialized as 0 if not initialized explicitly.\nIn C language, we can initialize the static variables using only constant literals.\nStatic global variables and functions are also possible in C++. They are mainly used to limit the scope of a variable or function to a file.\nWe should not declare static variables inside the structure because the C compiler requires the entire structure elements to be placed together.",

        "answer": "Yes, a variable can be both constant and volatile in C. we can use constant and volatile both variables together. The volatile and const variable together is used at the time of accessing the GPIO registers. In this case, its value is changed by the 'external factors' if a switch or any output device is attached with GPIO. In this situation, the volatile variable is important because it ensures that the compiler always read the value from the GPIO address and avoids making any assumption.",

Sometimes, the programmers fail to initialize the pointer with a valid address; these types of initialized pointers are known as dangling pointers. Dangling pointers occur at the time of the object's destruction when the object is deleted or de-allocated from memory without modifying the pointer's value.
