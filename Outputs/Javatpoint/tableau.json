        "question": "2) Explain the features of Tableau?",
        "answer": "There are three main features of Tableau, such as:\nData Blending: Data blending is an essential feature in Tableau. It is used when we combine related data from multiple data sources, which you want to analyze together in a single view, and represent in the form of a graph.\nReal-time Analysis: Real-Time Analysis makes users able to quickly understand and analyze dynamic data when the Velocity is high, and real-time analysis of data is complicated. Tableau can help extract valuable information from fast-moving data with interactive analytics.\nThe Collaboration of Data: Data analysis is not isolating task. That's why Tableau is built for collaboration. Team members can share data, make follow up queries, and forward easy-to-digest visualizations to others who could gain value from the data. Making sure everyone understands the data and can make informed decisions is critical to success.",

        "question": "3) How many tools in Tableau?",
        "answer": "There are five tools in Tableau, such as:\nTableau Desktop: Tableau Desktop establish connectivity between the Data Warehouse and other various types of files. The dashboards and the workbooks created here can be either shared locally or publicly. It allows us to code and customizes reports. Right from establishing the stories, charts to blending them all to form a dashboard, all the necessary work is created in Tableau Desktop.\nTableau Public: This Tableau version is specially built for cost-effective users. The word 'Public' means that the created workbooks cannot be saved locally. They should be kept on the Tableau's public cloud, which can be accessed and viewed by anyone.\nTableau Online: Its functionality is similar to the Tableau server, but data is stored on the server that hosted on the cloud, which is maintained by the Tableau group. There is no storage limit on the data which is published in the Tableau Online. Tableau Online creates a direct link over 40 data sources who are hosted in the cloud such as the Hive, MySQL, Spark SQL, Amazon Aurora, and many more.\nTableau Server: The software is correctly used to share the workbooks, visualizations, which is created in the Tableau Desktop application over the organization. To share dashboards in the Tableau Server, you should first publish your workbook in the Tableau Desktop. Once the workbook has been uploaded to the server, it will be accessible only to the authorized users.\nTableau Reader: Tableau Reader is a free tool which allows us to view the visualizations and workbooks, which is created using Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public. The data can be filtered, but modifications and editing are restricted. There is no security in Tableau Reader as anyone can view workbook using Tableau Reader.",

        "question": "4) Explain all data terminologies in Tableau?",
        "answer": "There are several types of data terminologies in Tableau, such as:\nBookmark: A .tbm document in the bookmarks folder in the Tableau repository that contains a single worksheet. It helps in improving data analysis. Unlike, web browser bookmarks, .tbm files are a compatible way to display various studies quickly.\nWorkbook: A workbook is a file with .twb extension that holds one or more worksheets as well as dashboards and stories.\nDashboard: The dashboard is a combination of several views that are arranged on a single page. In Tableau, dashboards are used to observe and compare a variety of data together, and also it allows interacting with other worksheets.\nData Source Page: Data Source is a page where you can set up your data source. Does this data source page generally consist of four main areas? Join area, left pane, a preview area, and metadata area.\nWorksheet: The worksheet is a collection of sheets. It's a place where you build views of your data by dragging various fields onto the shelves.\nDimensions: Dimension is commonly known as a field of categorical data. Dimensions hold discrete data such as members and hierarchies that cannot be aggregated. It also contains characteristic values such as dates, names, and geographical data. The dimensions used to reveal details of your information.\nMeasures: measures are the measurable quantities of the data, which can be analyzed by a dimension table. Measures are stored in a table which contains foreign keys referring uniquely to the associated dimension tables. The table supports data storage at the atomic level and thus, allows the number of records to be inserted at one time.\nFor example, a Sales table can have a product key, customer key, promotion key, items sold, referring to a specific event.\nFilters shelf: Filter shelf is located on the left side of the workbook. Filters shelf is used to exclude the data from a view by filtering it using both dimensions and measures.\nPages shelf: Page shelf is on the left side of the view. With the help of the page shelf, you can split a view into a sequence of pages based on the values and members in a continuous or discrete field. Adding a field with the pages shelf is similar to adding a field in rows shelf. For each new row, a new page is created.\nMarks card: Marks card is on the left side of the worksheet. The user can drag fields to the control mark properties such as color, type, shape, size, label, detail, and tooltip.",
