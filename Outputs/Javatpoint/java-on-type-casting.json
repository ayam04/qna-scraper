        "question": "1) What is type casting in Java?",
        "answer": "Type casting refers to the process of converting a value from one data type to another. Java supports two types of casting: implicit casting (also known as widening) and explicit casting (also known as narrowing). Implicit casting happens automatically when a data type with a smaller range is assigned to a larger data type. Explicit casting, on the other hand, requires a manual conversion and is used when assigning a larger data type to a smaller one.",

    },
    {
        "question": "2) What are the kinds of casting in Java?",
        "answer": "There are two kinds of casting.\nPrimitive Casting: When the information is cast from one type (like int, float) to another type, then, at that point, it is called Primitive Projecting.\nDerived Casting: When the information is cast starting with one inferred type and then onto the next derived kind, then it is called derived projecting.",
        "reference": "javatpoint.com"
    },
    {
        "question": "3) What is the Difference Between Implicit and Explicit Casting?",
        "answer": "Implicit casting involves converting a smaller data type to a larger data type without any manual intervention. For instance, converting an int to a double can be done implicitly since the double type can hold a larger range of values. However, implicit casting might result in a loss of precision for certain data types.\nExplicit casting, on the other hand, requires manual intervention and is necessary when converting a larger data type to a smaller one. Since this conversion might lead to data loss or truncation, the programmer needs to explicitly indicate their intention to perform the conversion.",

    },
    {
        "question": "4) How Can You Perform Explicit Casting in Java?",
        "answer": "To perform explicit casting in Java, you can use the syntax:\ntargetType variableName = (targetType) originalValue;  \nFor example, consider converting a double to an int:\ndouble pi = 3.14159;  \nint approxPi = (int) pi; // approxPi will hold the value 3",

    },
    {
        "question": "5) What is Upcasting and down casting?",
        "answer": "Upcasting involves converting a subclass object to its superclass type. This is done implicitly, as a subclass inherently possesses all the characteristics of its superclass. Upcasting allows for more generalized processing of objects and is a safe operation.\nDown casting, on the other hand, involves converting a superclass object to its subclass type. This is potentially unsafe because the superclass might not have all the attributes and behaviors of the subclass. To perform down casting, explicit casting is required, and it might result in a ClassCastException at runtime if the object is not of the expected subclass type.\nADVERTISEMENT",

    {
        "question": "",
        "answer": "The instanceof operator is used to check the compatibility of an object with a specific type before performing down casting. It returns true if the object is an instance of the specified type, and false otherwise. This operator helps prevent runtime errors that might occur due to incorrect down casting.\nclass Animal { }  \nclass Dog extends Animal { }  \nAnimal myDog = new Dog();  \nif (myDog instanceof Dog) {  \n    Dog dog = (Dog) myDog; // Safe down casting  \n}",

        "question": "7) What are Widening and Narrowing Conversions?",
        "answer": "Widening, also known as upcasting, is the process of converting a value from a smaller data type to a larger one. It is safe and doesn't result in data loss. For example, converting an int to a long is a widening conversion.\nNarrowing, also known as down casting, involves converting a value from a larger data type to a smaller one. This process requires explicit casting and might result in data loss or truncation. For example, converting a double to an int is a narrowing conversion.",

    },
    {
        "question": "8) Can You Explain Type Promotion in Expressions?",
        "answer": "Type promotion occurs in expressions involving different data types. In such cases, Java automatically promotes the data types to a common, compatible type. For example, if you have an expression involving an int and a double, the int will be automatically promoted to a double before the expression is evaluated.",

    {
        "question": "10) How does Java handle type casting for primitive data types and reference data types differently?",
        "answer": "In Java, primitive data types have distinct memory representations and different ranges of values. When casting between primitive data types, we need to consider compatibility and possible loss of data. On the other hand, reference data types (objects) are manipulated through references, and type casting often involves upcasting and down casting. The instanceof operator is used to check the compatibility of reference types before performing down casting.",

    },
    {
        "question": "",
        "answer": "Loss of precision refers to the situation where converting a value from one data type to another results in the loss of some information or accuracy. This often occurs in narrowing conversions, where a larger data type (with a wider range of values and more precision) is being converted to a smaller data type (with a narrower range of values and less precision). For example, converting a double value like 3.14159 to an int will result in loss of precision, as the decimal part is truncated.",

    },
    {
        "question": "12) What is the potential risk of using explicit casting for down casting?",
        "answer": "Down casting involves converting a superclass object to a subclass type. This process requires explicit casting and might lead to a ClassCastException at runtime if the object is not of the expected subclass type. It's crucial to use the instanceof operator to verify the compatibility of the object before attempting down casting to avoid runtime errors.",

        "answer": "int num = 5;  \ndouble result = num + 3.5;  \nIn this case, the int value num is automatically promoted to a double before performing the addition with 3.5. This is an example of type promotion, where different data types in an expression are promoted to a common, compatible type to perform the operation.",

    },
    {
        "question": "14) Is type casting applicable only to numerical data types?",
        "answer": "No, type casting is not limited to numerical data types. While numerical type casting is a common scenario, type casting can also be applied to non-numerical data types, such as casting between different reference types (objects). It's important to understand the principles of type casting and apply them whenever there's a need to convert data from one type to another.",

    },
    {
        "question": "15) How can you prevent loss of data during type casting?",
        "answer": "To prevent loss of data during type casting, consider using conditional checks or validation mechanisms. For instance, before performing explicit casting, you can check the range and validity of the data to ensure that no significant data loss occurs. Additionally, using wider data types when necessary can help avoid loss of precision during calculations.",

    },
    {
        "question": "16) What is type casting ambiguity, and how can it be resolved?",
        "answer": "Type casting ambiguity occurs when there are multiple possible ways to interpret a cast. For instance, consider casting an expression involving multiple data types. To resolve ambiguity, we can use parentheses to explicitly define the order of casting, ensuring that the desired type conversion is applied first.",

    {
        "question": "",
        "answer": "Reference type casting involves converting a reference of one object type to another object type, while primitive type casting involves converting values between different primitive data types.

    },
    {
        "question": "18) Can you cast between incompatible reference types?",
        "answer": "No, you cannot cast between reference types that are not related by inheritance. Casting between unrelated types will result in a ClassCastException at runtime. For example, you cannot cast between a String and a java.util.List.",

    },
    {
        "question": "19) What is the role of typecasting in method overloading?",
        "answer": "Type casting can play a role in method overloading when multiple methods have the same name but different parameter types. In this case, the appropriate method to call is determined based on the compatibility of the arguments provided. Type casting might be needed to match the expected parameter type, especially in cases involving widening conversions.",

    },
    {
        "question": "20) How does type casting apply to arrays?",
        "answer": "Type casting can be used with arrays to convert arrays of one data type to arrays of another data type. This is often required when working with arrays of primitive types. However, it's important to note that casting an array only changes the reference type, not the actual elements within the array.",
        "reference": "javatpoint.com"
    },
    {
        "question": "21) Can you explain the concept of automatic type promotion in expressions?",
        "answer": "Automatic type promotion refers to the implicit conversion that Java performs on operands in expressions involving mixed data types. When different data types are used in an expression, Java promotes the operands to a common type, ensuring compatibility for the operation. For instance, in an expression involving an int and a long, the int is promoted to a long before the operation.",
