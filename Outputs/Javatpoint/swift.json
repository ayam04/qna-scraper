        "question": "1) What is Swift? How is it different from Objective-C?",
        "answer": "Swift and Objective-C both are used in iOS development but both are significantly different in terms of efficiency and usage.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSwift is an open-source programming language developed by Apple platform and expanded to build on Linus while Objective-C is not an open-source programming language and is limited to Apple.\nSwift syntax is easy, clear and brief. It makes API's easy to read and maintain while Objective-C is based on C language which is comparatively hard to use.\nSwift is more rational and precise that's why it has less number of code and easy to learn while Objective-C code is lengthy as double to Swift code.\nSwift can be compiled as a dynamic framework while Objective-C cannot be compiled into static libraries and dynamic framework.\nFor more information: Click Here...",

        "question": "2) What is the meaning of question mark \"?\" in Swift?",
        "answer": "In Swift, question mark \"?\" is used in property declaration. It tells the compiler that this property is optional. The property may hold a value or not. It avoids runtime errors when accessing that property by using ?. This is useful in optional chaining and a variant of this example is in conditional clauses.\nFor example:\nvar optionalName : String? = \"John\"  \nif optionalName != nil {  \n    print(\"Your name is \\(optionalName!)\")  \n}",
