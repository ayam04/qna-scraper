It is an electronic device that operates only at the physical layer. Before it becomes weak, it receives the signal in the network, regenerates the signal bit pattern, and puts the refreshed copy back into the link.\nB. Bridges:\nBridges operate in both the data link layer and physical layer of lans of the same type. A large network is divided by the bridges into smaller segments. Bridges contain logic that allows them to keep the traffic for each segment separate, and for that, the repeaters relay frame inside the segment containing the intended recipient and control congestion.\nC. Routers:\nAmong multiple interconnected networks, the packets are relayed by the routers. Routers operate in data link, physical, and network layers. Router's content software enables them to the determination of several possible paths, i.e., which path is best for a particular transmission.\nD. Gateway:\nA gateway is a networked device that acts as an entry point into another network when discussing networking (network devices gateway). For example, a wireless router is typically utilized as the default gateway in a home network.
