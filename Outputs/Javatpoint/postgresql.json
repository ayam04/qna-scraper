It has completed more than 30 years of active development on the core platform. It has been ACID-compliant since 2001 and runs on all the major operating systems. It also has an add-on like PostGIS database extender.\nMichel Stonebraker is known as the father of PostgreSQL. He started and led the development of this database in 1986 as a follow-up project to its predecessor, Ingres, now owned by Computer Associates. PostgreSQL was originally called Postgres. It is pronounced PostgreSQL because of its ubiquitous support for the SQL standards among most relational databases. PostgreSQL is used as a by default database in MAC OS.\nPostgres was started by Michael Stonebraker in 1986 as a follow-up project to its predecessor, Ingres, which Computer Associates now own. The name Postgres was derived from its predecessor Ingres. Here, Postgres means \"after Ingres\". The first project of Postgres was developed between 1986 - 1994. It has provided many sophisticated features such as Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC), point in time recovery, tablespaces, asynchronous replication, nested transactions (savepoints), online/hot backups, a sophisticated query planner/optimizer, and write-ahead logging for fault tolerance.",
