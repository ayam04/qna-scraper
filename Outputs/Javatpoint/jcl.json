        "question": "1) What is JCL?",
        "answer": "JCL stands for Job Control Language. JCL is a scripting language used on IBM mainframe operating system to instruct the system for the batch job. It is a set of statements that you code to tell the operating system about the task you want to perform. Sometimes this set of statements is quite large, but most jobs can be run using a minimal subset.\n\nJCL statements tell OS where to find the required input, how to process that input, and what to do with the resulting output.",

        "question": "2) How does JCL act on a COBOL code?",
        "answer": "There are a particular set of divisions that deals with JCL.\nIdentification Division\nAct as introductory part to JCL. It introduces program name, author, date, etc. no interacting code to JCL.\nEnvironment Division\nEnvironment division allows JCL to interact with OS. OS sends a request for Files under file operation.\nData Division\nIt works with the accessed file according to operations to READ or to PRINT files (with the help of OS).\nProcedure Division\nIt contains various actions taken on files, e.g., to close files that are being used.",

        "question": "3) What is condition checking in JCL? Is this possible?",
        "answer": "JCL supports condition checking. Condition checking is possible at both the job level and the code level. It is done through the COND keyword with a return code and operand as predefined in JCL. So it is feasible in JCL.",
        "reference": "javatpoint.com"
    },
    {
        "question": "4) Does JCL support automatic restart?",
        "answer": "It is possible to have an automatic restart in JCL through the help of some predefined keyword parameter. The RDkeyword is one of those keywords that are used to restart. It generally succeeds in an irregular termination of the program. Against the locale of the automatic restart, we need to consider the importance of checkpoints, which are used to define the job execution at various points in the program concerned.",

        "question": "5) Explain the JOB statement in JCL?",
        "answer": "JOB statement gives the job identity to the Operating System (OS) in the spool and the scheduler. It is the first control statement in a JCL. The available parameters in the JOB statement help the OS in allocating the right scheduler. It is also useful for analyzing the required CPU time and issuing notifications to the user.\nSyntax\nThe basic syntax of a JCL JOB statement is below.\n//Job-name JOB Positional-param, Keyword-param",

        "question": "6) Explain the JCL EXEC statement?",
        "answer": "A JCL can be made of many job steps, and a job step can execute a program directly, or it can call a procedure. Thus, JCL can execute one or more programs (job steps).\nThe statement, which contains the job step program information, is called the EXEC statement.\nThe motive of the EXEC statement is to provide the required information. This information is forwarded to the program that executes in the job step.\nSyntax\nThe basic syntax of a JCL EXEC statement is as follows.\n//Step-name EXEC Positional-param, Keyword-param",

The steps for determining the job are as follows.\nIdentify the job.\nExecute the program named by the user.\nSeveral DD's that define the files being utilized.\nPrevious work should be closed operation, exit operation.",

These files are stored on the Direct Access Storage Device (DASD) or Tapes of the mainframe and are basic data storage areas. If these data are required to be manipulated in a batch program, then the physical dataset name along with the file format is coded in a JCL.\nDD statement's help gives the dataset definition that is used in JCL. The required input and output resources for a job step needs to be described within a DD statement. These resources must be specified with information such as the dataset organization, storage requirements, and record length.\nSyntax\n\nThe basic syntax for JCL DD is as follows.\n//DD-name DD Parameters",
