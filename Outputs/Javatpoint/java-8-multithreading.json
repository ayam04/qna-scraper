        "question": "What are the new features introduced in Java 8 for multithreading?",
        "answer": "Java 8 introduced the concept of Lambda expressions and Streams, which greatly simplified the process of multithreading. The Streams API allows developers to perform functional-style operations on streams of elements, such as filter, map, and reduce, in a parallel and efficient manner. Additionally, the Executor framework was enhanced with new classes, such as ForkJoinPool and CompletableFuture, which provide more powerful and flexible ways to manage threads and perform asynchronous operations.",

    {
        "question": "How does the ForkJoinPool class work?",
        "answer": "ForkJoinPool is a specialized ExecutorService that is designed for running Fork-Join style computations. It works by dividing a task into smaller subtasks, which are then executed concurrently by worker threads in the pool. The results of the subtasks are then combined to produce the final result. The ForkJoinPool class also supports work stealing, which allows idle worker threads to steal work from other busy threads, resulting in more efficient use of resources.",

        "answer": "The main difference between parallelStream() and stream() is that parallelStream() returns a parallel stream, which is optimized for parallel execution, while stream() returns a sequential stream, which is executed in a single thread. When using a parallel stream, the operations are executed concurrently by multiple threads, while with a sequential stream, the operations are executed one after the other in a single thread.",

        "answer": "CompletableFuture is a class that represents the result of an asynchronous computation. It can be used to perform long-running operations in a separate thread, and then receive the result of the computation when it is complete. This can be done by calling the supplyAsync() method, which takes a supplier function and returns a CompletableFuture object. The supplier function performs the asynchronous computation, and the CompletableFuture object can be used to retrieve the result of the computation or to register callbacks to be executed when the computation is complete.",

        "answer": "A thread is a lightweight, independent unit of execution within a process. It shares the same memory space with other threads belonging to the same process and can communicate with other threads within the same process. A process, on the other hand, is a heavyweight, independent unit of execution with its own memory space. It can contain multiple threads and can communicate with other processes through inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms. In Java, threads are created and managed using the java.util.concurrent package, while processes are managed by the operating system.",

        "question": "How can you synchronize access to shared resources in a multithreaded environment?",
        "answer": "Java provides several ways to synchronize access to shared resources in a multithreaded environment. One way is to use the synchronized keyword, which can be applied to methods or blocks of code. When a thread enters a synchronized method or block, it acquires a lock on the object, preventing other threads from entering the same method or block until the lock is released. Another way is to use the java.util.concurrent.locks package, which provides more advanced locking mechanisms such as ReentrantLock, ReadWriteLock and StampedLock. These locks can be used to implement more fine-grained control over access to shared resources.",

        "answer": "Both the wait() and sleep() methods are used to control the execution of threads in Java, but they work in different ways. The wait() method is used to release a lock on an object, allowing other threads to acquire the lock and access the shared resource. The thread that calls wait() goes into a waiting state and can only be resumed when another thread calls notify() or notifyAll() on the same object. On the other hand, the sleep() method is used to pause the execution of a thread for a specified amount of time. The thread goes into a \"sleeping\" state and resumes execution after the specified time has elapsed.",

The Executor is an interface that defines a single method execute() for running a Runnable task. The ExecutorService is a subinterface of Executor that adds methods for managing the lifecycle of the threads, such as shutdown and awaitTermination.

A CountDownLatch is used to block the execution of one or more threads until a specific condition is met. It has a counter that is initialized to a specific value, and each time the countDown() method is called, the counter is decremented. When the counter reaches zero, the threads that are waiting on the latch are released. A CyclicBarrier, on the other hand, is used to block the execution of multiple threads until all threads have reached a specific point in the execution. When all threads have reached the barrier, they are released and can continue execution.",

The Runnable interface has a single method run() that does not return any value and cannot throw checked exceptions. The Callable interface, on the other hand, has a single method call() that returns a value and can throw checked exceptions.

        "answer": "The parallel() method in the Streams API can be used to convert a sequential stream into a parallel stream, which can improve the performance of certain operations. When a stream is parallel, the operations are executed concurrently by multiple threads, which can lead to faster execution times. However, it is important to note that not all operations benefit from parallel execution, and in some cases, using a parallel stream can actually decrease performance. To determine if using a parallel stream will improve performance, it is recommended to test the code with both sequential and parallel streams and compare the execution times.",
