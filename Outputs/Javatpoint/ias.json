Even a state government cannot take action against IAS officials without taking permission from MHRD.

India is a developing and welfare-oriented nation, And IAS are involved in the formulation and implementation of national policies, which gives an IAS officer ample opportunity to problem-solving, innovating, and bringing ideas to life.

You will get bashed in the interview if you won't be able to put up the fact and give back your statement logically.\nSo, you should always say meaningful things and always be ready to follow up questions.\nIf you don't know anything, then you can say I don't know.\nSaying irrelevant things will lead one thing to another, and you will end up with a bad interview experience.

Because of these fields' very nature, engineering students understand competitive exams better than the Arts graduates.",

        "answer": "The subject selection for the UPSC exam depends on your choice. It doesn't matter from which background you are. For the civil service exam (IAS/IFS/IPS), you have to choose only one optional, and for IFoS, you have to choose 2. If you are an engineering graduate, Mathematics will be a good optional for which you might have the pre-requisite knowledge. But you should select Mathematics only if you have an interest in that subject. Always remember that coaching for Mathematics is not widely available compared to other subjects. If you think you can prepare the subject by yourself only then opt for it.\nIf you don't feel confident in Mathematics, you should focus on the big four art subjects (History, Geography, Polity, and Economics).\nSelect one subject you find interesting, and feel the confidence you can write the answers, refer to previous year question papers. The biggest advantages of these subjects are that you can find many trainers and study materials who can guide you. Find someone who can guide you. It can be any coaching institute or anyone from your friends or family.\nBesides these subjects, Public Administration is also a good choice. Don't go for engineering subjects like Mechanical, Civil or Electrical if you don't feel confident. These subjects are lengthy, took a lot of time.\nNote: Choose your optional only on your interest. Remember your optional subject is a very crucial factor to get you in the final list.",

        "question": "7) How to choose the optional subject for UPSC Civil Services Exam?",
        "answer": "Many aspects should be kept in mind while choosing an Optional Subject for the UPSC exam:\n1. Interest and academic background of the aspirant\nBefore choosing your Optional, you should identify your interest in a subject. Go through school level NCERT's (Class 11th and 12th preferably), and check the Optional subject syllabus and your comfort level in reading the subject.\nFor example:\n(a) If you are from the Commerce background, look for what you have already studied in college and choose accordingly between Commerce, Management or Public Administration.\n(b) If you are from an Engineering background, check the syllabus and content of optional subjects like Physics, Chemistry, Maths, Engineering optional - Civil, Electrical, Mechanical etc. If you are not comfortable with the science subjects mentioned, check other optional subjects such as Geography, Psychology, Anthropology, Political Science, Sociology, Public Administration, Philosophy etc.\n2. Coaching and Trainers available for the subject\nYou can talk to your seniors, friends, and civil servants who have already qualified to identify the best coaching classes available in your city. Study material from good coaching, along with the classes conducted, can accelerate your preparation.\n3. Contribution of the Optional Subject towards General Study syllabus\nThis point is very important, and that's why many aspirants take humanities subjects as their optional because they cover a good part of the general study.\n4. Performance of the optional subject in the recent past (at least past three years)\nThe individual performance of a candidate can vary on a large number of parameters compared to his competitors. You can find that some optional subjects do not fetch the marks desired compared to the effort put in by candidates. You should avoid those subjects.\n5. Time Management\nTime management is the biggest factor to be selected in the UPSC exam. The candidate should decide how much time he/she would spend studying an Optional Subject. A few candidates might be working while preparing or studying at a university. They should choose optional by estimating the amount of time required to study the chosen optional subject and General Studies.",
