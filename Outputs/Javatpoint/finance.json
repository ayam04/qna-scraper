        "answer": "We should use the cash flow statement if we are limited to choosing only one statement to review a company's overall health. The main reason behind choosing this statement is that cash is king, and the cash flow gives a true picture of how much cash the company is generating. It is a behavioral question, so you can probably pick a different answer for this question, but you have to provide a good justification. For example, you can choose the balance sheet and say that assets are the true driver of cash flow. You can even choose an income statement and say that it shows the company's earning power and profitability.",
