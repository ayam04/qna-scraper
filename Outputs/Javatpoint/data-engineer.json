        "answer": "This is an advanced-level data engineering question. This is a complex coding question, and these types of coding questions are commonly asked in data engineering interviews.\nBoth *args and **kwargs are used in Python and specify that a function accepts any number of arguments. The *args is used to define an ordered function, and **kwargs represents an unordered argument used in a function. Here, *args refer to regular arguments (e.g. myFun(1,2,3)) and **kwargs refer to keyword arguments (e.g. myFun(name=\"jtp\")).\nFor example, if you want to declare a function for summing numbers. You will get one problem with this function by default, as it only accepts a fixed number of arguments.\nExample:\nFollowing is a regular function for summing numbers, expecting a single argument of type list:\ndef sum_numbers(numbers):  \n   the_sum = 0  \n   for number in numbers:  \n       the_sum += number  \n return the_sum  \nWe can use it to find the sum:\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  \nsum_numbers(numbers)  \n>>> 21   \nHere, the *args facilitates you to do the same without using a list:\ndef sum_numbers(*args):  \n   the_sum = 0  \n   for number in args:  \n       the_sum += number  \n   return the_sum  \nsum_numbers(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)  \n>>> 21   \nOn the other hand, **kwargs are used to unpack dictionaries. For example, if you want to multiply 3 numbers, those come from some external source and are stored as key-value pairs. Here, the keys are always identical, but the values change.\n\nFollowing is the simple backend code:\ndef multiply(a, b, c):  \n    return a * b * c  \nFollowing is the data you got:  \nd = {'a': 3, 'b': 2, 'c': 5}  \nA simple approach:\nmultiply(a=d['a'], b=d['b'], c=d['c'])  \n>>> 30  \nBy using **kwargs:\nmultiply(**d)  \n>>> 30",

        "answer": "There are mainly two design schemas used in data modeling. They are as follows:\n1. Star schema: Star schema is the basic and simplest schema among the data mart schema. It follows a mature modeling approach widely adopted by relational data warehouses. It needs modelers to classify their model tables as either dimension or fact. Dimension tables specify business entities, i.e., the things we model, and the business entities consist of products, people, places, and concepts, including time itself.\n\nThe star schema is mainly used to develop or build a data warehouse and dimensional data marts. It is also a necessary cause of the snowflake schema. The star schema is also efficient in handling basic queries.\n2. Snowflake schema: The snowflake schema is a typical variant of the star schema. It is a logical arrangement of tables in a multidimensional database in such a way that the entity-relationship diagram resembles a snowflake shape. That's why it is called snowflake schema. The snowflake schema is represented by centralized fact tables connected to multiple dimensions. In the snowflake schema, the centralized fact table is connected to multiple dimensions, and all dimensions are present in a normalized form in multiple related tables.\nThe snowflake structure occurs in the case when the dimensions of a star schema are detailed and highly structured, having several levels of relationship, and the child tables have multiple parent tables. This schema affects only the dimension tables and does not affect the fact tables.",

So, the star schema clarifies common business reporting logic, such as as-of reporting and period-over-period.\nNo need to design cubes: All OLAP systems use star schema to design OLAP cubes efficiently. Most OLAP systems deliver a ROLAP mode of operation using a star schema as a source without designing a cube structure.\nDisadvantages of Star schema:\nStar schema is a highly de-normalized schema state so that that data integrity may be a drawback. In this schema, data integrity is not enforced well.\nIt is not a highly normalized data model, so it is not flexible if the analytical needs a normalized data model.\nThe star schema doesn't reinforce many-to-many relationships within business entities frequently.",

In this schema, data is more structured, so data integrity problems are reduced and not very common.\nSnowflake schema uses less disk space than the denormalized model because data is normalized in this model, and there is minimal data redundancy.\nThere is a very low risk of data integrity violations and a low level of data redundancy in the Snowflake schema model. That's why maintenance is simple and easy.\nIn the Snowflake schema, we can use complex queries that don't work with a star schema. It provides more space for powerful analytics.\nThe Snowflake schema supports many-to-many relationships.\nDisadvantages of the Snowflake schema\nThe Snowflake schema is harder to design as compared to the Star schema.\nThe Snowflake schema requires more complex queries that use several numbers of joins that can significantly decrease the Snowflake schema's performance.\nMaintenance in the Snowflake schema is also more complex because of the many different tables present in the data warehouse.\nQueries in the Snowflake schema can be very complex and may have many levels of joins between many tables.\nBecause of the many joins that have to produce the final output, queries in the Snowflake schema are slower in some cases.\nWe require some specific skills to work with data stored using snowflake schema.",

Anyone can understand and use it and make some modifications according to their industry requirement.\nHadoop is fault-tolerant. If somehow any of your systems got crashed, it provides data availability. In Hadoop, data is replicated on various DataNodes in a Hadoop cluster that ensures data availability every time.

DAS is also an acronym that stands for Direct Attached Storage.\nIn NAS, computation and storage layers are separate layers, and storage is distributed over different servers on a network. That's why it provides high storage capacity. In DAS, storage is not distributed, and it is attached to the node where computation takes place. That's why it provides lower storage capacity.\nStorage capacity in NAS is 109 to 1012 bytes. Storage capacity in DAS is 109 bytes.\nApache Hadoop follows the principle of moving processing near the location of data. So it requires a local storage disk for computation. DAS provides very good performance on a Hadoop cluster. It can also be implemented on commodity hardware, which is more cost-effective than NAS.\nNAS storage is preferred only when we have very high bandwidth.
