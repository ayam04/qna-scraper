        "question": "1) What is an interface in Java?",
        "answer": "An interface is a reference type in Java that is similar to a class. It outlines a contract that classes must adhere to by defining a set of methods. Interfaces cannot be instantiated directly and are used for achieving multiple inheritance and code reusability.",

    },
    {
        "question": "2) How is an interface declared?",

    },
    {
        "question": "4) How can a class implement an interface?",
        "answer": "To implement an interface, a class should use the implements keyword. For instance:\nclass MyClass implements MyInterface {  \n    public void myMethod() {  \n        // Implementation here  \n    }  \n}",
