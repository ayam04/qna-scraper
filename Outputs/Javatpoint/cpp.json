        "answer": "Following are the differences between C and C++:\nC C++\nC language was developed by Dennis Ritchie. C++ language was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup.\nC is a structured programming language. C++ supports both structural and object-oriented programming language.\nC is a subset of C++. C++ is a superset of C.\nIn C language, data and functions are the free entities. In the C++ language, both data and functions are encapsulated together in the form of a project.\nC does not support the data hiding. Therefore, the data can be used by the outside world.\nC++ supports data hiding. Therefore, the data cannot be accessed by the outside world.\nC supports neither function nor operator overloading. C++ supports both function and operator overloading.\nIn C, the function cannot be implemented inside the structures. In the C++, the function can be implemented inside the structures.\nReference variables are not supported in C language. C++ supports the reference variables.\nC language does not support the virtual and friend functions.\nC++ supports both virtual and friend functions.\nIn C, scanf() and printf() are mainly used for input/output. C++ mainly uses stream cin and cout to perform input and output operations.\n4) What is the difference between reference and pointer?\nFollowing are the differences between reference and pointer:\nReference Pointer\nReference behaves like an alias for an existing variable, i.e., it is a temporary variable.\nThe pointer is a variable which stores the address of a variable.\nReference variable does not require any indirection operator to access the value. A reference variable can be used directly to access the value. Pointer variable requires an indirection operator to access the value of a variable.\nOnce the reference variable is assigned, then it cannot be reassigned with different address values. The pointer variable is an independent variable means that it can be reassigned to point to different objects.\nA null value cannot be assigned to the reference variable. A null value can be assigned to the reference variable.\nIt is necessary to initialize the variable at the time of declaration.

        "question": "6) What are the various OOPs concepts in C++?",
        "answer": "The various OOPS concepts in C++ are:\n\nClass:\nThe class is a user-defined data type which defines its properties and its functions. For example, Human being is a class. The body parts of a human being are its properties, and the actions performed by the body parts are known as functions. The class does not occupy any memory space. Therefore, we can say that the class is the only logical representation of the data.\n\nThe syntax of declaring the class:\nclass student  \n{  \n//data members;  \n//Member functions  \n}  \nObject:\nAn object is a run-time entity. An object is the instance of the class. An object can represent a person, place or any other item. An object can operate on both data members and member functions. The class does not occupy any memory space. When an object is created using a new keyword, then space is allocated for the variable in a heap, and the starting address is stored in the stack memory. When an object is created without a new keyword, then space is not allocated in the heap memory, and the object contains the null value in the stack.\nclass Student  \n{  \n//data members;  \n//Member functions  \n}  \nThe syntax for declaring the object:\nStudent s = new Student();  \nInheritance:\nInheritance provides reusability. Reusability means that one can use the functionalities of the existing class. It eliminates the redundancy of code. Inheritance is a technique of deriving a new class from the old class. The old class is known as the base class, and the new class is known as derived class.\nSyntax\nclass derived_class :: visibility-mode base_class;   \nNote: The visibility-mode can be public, private, protected.\nEncapsulation:\nEncapsulation is a technique of wrapping the data members and member functions in a single unit. It binds the data within a class, and no outside method can access the data. If the data member is private, then the member function can only access the data.\nAbstraction:\nAbstraction is a technique of showing only essential details without representing the implementation details. If the members are defined with a public keyword, then the members are accessible outside also. If the members are defined with a private keyword, then the members are not accessible by the outside methods.\nData binding:\nData binding is a process of binding the application UI and business logic. Any change made in the business logic will reflect directly to the application UI.\nPolymorphism:\nPolymorphism means multiple forms. Polymorphism means having more than one function with the same name but with different functionalities. Polymorphism is of two types:\nStatic polymorphism is also known as early binding.\nDynamic polymorphism is also known as late binding.",

        "answer": "Polymorphism: Polymorphism means multiple forms. It means having more than one function with the same function name but with different functionalities.\nPolymorphism is of two types:\n\nRuntime polymorphism\n\nRuntime polymorphism is also known as dynamic polymorphism. Function overriding is an example of runtime polymorphism. Function overriding means when the child class contains the method which is already present in the parent class. Hence, the child class overrides the method of the parent class. In case of function overriding, parent and child class both contains the same function with the different definition. The call to the function is determined at runtime is known as runtime polymorphism.\nLet's understand this through an example:\n#include <iostream>  \nusing namespace std;  \nclass Base  \n{  \n    public:  \n    virtual void show()  \n    {  \n        cout<<\"javaTpoint\";  \n     }  \n};  \nclass Derived:public Base  \n{  \n    public:  \n    void show()  \n    {  \n        cout<<\"javaTpoint tutorial\";  \n    }  \n};  \n  int main()  \n{  \n    Base* b;  \n    Derived d;  \n    b=&d;  \n    b->show();  \n                return 0;  \n}  \nOutput:\njavaTpoint tutorial\nCompile time polymorphism\nCompile-time polymorphism is also known as static polymorphism. The polymorphism which is implemented at the compile time is known as compile-time polymorphism. Method overloading is an example of compile-time polymorphism.\nMethod overloading: Method overloading is a technique which allows you to have more than one function with the same function name but with different functionality.\nMethod overloading can be possible on the following basis:\nThe return type of the overloaded function.\nThe type of the parameters passed to the function.\nThe number of parameters passed to the function.\n\nLet's understand this through an example:\n#include <iostream>  \nusing namespace std;  \nclass Multiply  \n{  \n   public:  \n   int mul(int a,int b)  \n   {  \n       return(a*b);  \n   }  \n   int mul(int a,int b,int c)  \n   {  \n       return(a*b*c);  \n  }  \n };  \nint main()  \n{  \n    Multiply multi;  \n    int res1,res2;  \n    res1=multi.mul(2,3);  \n    res2=multi.mul(2,3,4);  \n    cout<<\"\\n\";  \n    cout<<res1;  \n    cout<<\"\\n\";  \n    cout<<res2;  \n    return 0;  \n}  \nOutput:\n6\n24\nIn the above example, mul() is an overloaded function with the different number of parameters.",

        "answer": "The namespace is a logical division of the code which is designed to stop the naming conflict.\nThe namespace defines the scope where the identifiers such as variables, class, functions are declared.\nThe main purpose of using namespace in C++ is to remove the ambiguity. Ambiquity occurs when the different task occurs with the same name.\nFor example: if there are two functions exist with the same name such as add(). In order to prevent this ambiguity, the namespace is used. Functions are declared in different namespaces.\nC++ consists of a standard namespace, i.e., std which contains inbuilt classes and functions. So, by using the statement \"using namespace std;\" includes the namespace \"std\" in our program.\nSyntax of namespace:\nnamespace namespace_name  \n{  \n //body of namespace;  \n}  \nSyntax of accessing the namespace variable:\nnamespace_name::member_name;  \nLet's understand this through an example:\n#include <iostream>  \nusing namespace std;  \nnamespace addition  \n{  \n    int a=5;  \n    int b=5;  \n    int add()  \n    {  \n        return(a+b);  \n    }  \n}  \n  int main() {  \nint result;  \nresult=addition::add();  \ncout<<result;  \nreturn 0;  \n}  \nOutput:\n10",

        "answer": "Following are the operations that can be performed on pointers:\nIncrementing or decrementing a pointer: Incrementing a pointer means that we can increment the pointer by the size of a data type to which it points.\nThere are two types of increment pointers:\n1. Pre-increment pointer: The pre-increment operator increments the operand by 1, and the value of the expression becomes the resulting value of the incremented. Suppose ptr is a pointer then pre-increment pointer is represented as ++ptr.\nLet's understand this through an example:\n#include <iostream>  \nusing namespace std;  \nint main()  \n{  \nint a[5]={1,2,3,4,5};  \nint *ptr;  \nptr=&a[0];  \ncout<<\"Value of *ptr is : \"<<*ptr<<\"\\n\";  \ncout<<\"Value of *++ptr : \"<<*++ptr;  \nreturn 0;  \n}  \nOutput:\nValue of *ptr is : 1\nValue of *++ptr : 2\n2. Post-increment pointer: The post-increment operator increments the operand by 1, but the value of the expression will be the value of the operand prior to the incremented value of the operand. Suppose ptr is a pointer then post-increment pointer is represented as ptr++.\nLet's understand this through an example:\n#include <iostream>  \nusing namespace std;  \nint main()  \n{  \nint a[5]={1,2,3,4,5};  \nint *ptr;  \nptr=&a[0];  \ncout<<\"Value of *ptr is : \"<<*ptr<<\"\\n\";  \ncout<<\"Value of *ptr++ : \"<<*ptr++;  \nreturn 0;  \n}  \nOutput:\nValue of *ptr is : 1\nValue of *ptr++ : 1\nSubtracting a pointer from another pointer: When two pointers pointing to the members of an array are subtracted, then the number of elements present between the two members are returned.",

Sometimes, it is necessary for the non-member function to access the data. The friend function is a non-member function and has the ability to access the private data of the class.\nTo make an outside function friendly to the class, we need to declare the function as a friend of the class as shown below:\nclass sample  \n{  \n   // data members;  \n public:  \nfriend void abc(void);  \n};  \nFollowing are the characteristics of a friend function:\nThe friend function is not in the scope of the class in which it has been declared.\nSince it is not in the scope of the class, so it cannot be called by using the object of the class.

For example, we can create a template of an array class which will enable us to create an array of various types such as int, float, char, etc. Similarly, we can create a template for a function, suppose we have a function add(), then we can create multiple versions of add().\nThe syntax of a class template:\ntemplate<class T>  \nclass classname  \n{  \n  // body of class;  \n};  \nSyntax of a object of a template class:\nclassname<type> objectname(arglist);",

        "question": "38) What is the difference between function overloading and operator overloading?",
        "answer": "Function overloading: Function overloading is defined as we can have more than one version of the same function. The versions of a function will have different signature means that they have a different set of parameters.\nOperator overloading: Operator overloading is defined as the standard operator can be redefined so that it has a different meaning when applied to the instances of a class.",

        "question": "39) What is a virtual destructor?",
        "answer": "A virtual destructor in C++ is used in the base class so that the derived class object can also be destroyed. A virtual destructor is declared by using the ~ tilde operator and then virtual keyword before the constructor.\nNote: Constructor cannot be virtual, but destructor can be virtual.\nLet's understand this through an example\nExample without using virtual destructor\n#include <iostream>  \nusing namespace std;  \nclass Base  \n{  \n    public:  \n    Base()  \n    {  \n        cout<<\"Base constructor is called\"<<\"\\n\";  \n    }  \n    ~Base()  \n    {  \n        cout<<\"Base class object is destroyed\"<<\"\\n\";  \n    }  \n};  \nclass Derived:public Base  \n{  \n    public:  \n    Derived()  \n    {  \n        cout<<\"Derived class constructor is called\"<<\"\\n\";  \n    }  \n    ~Derived()  \n    {  \n        cout<<\"Derived class object is destroyed\"<<\"\\n\";  \n    }  \n};  \nint main()   \n{  \n  Base* b= new Derived;  \n  delete b;  \n  return 0;  \n    }  \nOutput:\nBase constructor is called\nDerived class constructor is called\nBase class object is destroyed\nIn the above example, delete b will only call the base class destructor due to which derived class destructor remains undestroyed. This leads to the memory leak.\nExample with a virtual destructor\n#include <iostream>  \nusing namespace std;  \nclass Base  \n{  \n    public:  \n    Base()  \n    {  \n        cout<<\"Base constructor is called\"<<\"\\n\";  \n    }  \n    virtual ~Base()  \n    {  \n        cout<<\"Base class object is destroyed\"<<\"\\n\";  \n    }  \n};  \nclass Derived:public Base  \n{  \n    public:  \n    Derived()  \n    {  \n        cout<<\"Derived class constructor is called\"<<\"\\n\";  \n    }  \n    ~Derived()  \n    {  \n        cout<<\"Derived class object is destroyed\"<<\"\\n\";  \n    }  \n};  \nint main()   \n{  \n  Base* b= new Derived;  \n  delete b;  \n  return 0;  \n    }  \nOutput:\nBase constructor is called\nDerived class constructor is called\nDerived class object is destroyed\nBase class object is destroyed\nWhen we use the virtual destructor, then the derived class destructor is called first, and then the base class destructor is called.",
