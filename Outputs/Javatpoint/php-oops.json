The Constructor is used to make an object of its group type, which is utilized to introduce the properties of the item utilizing a technique called _construct (). The Constructor in PHP can be overloaded by passing the various contentions by calling a similar technique with a different number of contentions inside a similar class statement.\nThe Destructor in a PHP is utilized when the life span of a declared object is finished to deliver the memory involved by it or to gather something similar. The destructor can be called utilizing the method _destruct ().",

A Namespace can be characterized by utilizing the catchphrase.

        "question": "10) How to call the parent constructor?",
        "answer": "The parent constructor can be easily called by implementing this parent::__construct(). But while calling the parent constructor, we face two cases.\nCase 1: If the child class already contains a constructor, we can't run the parent class constructor directly. To solve this problem, we have to call the above parameter within the child constructor.\nExample:\n<?php  \n   class father{  \n      public function __construct(){  \n         echo \"this is the parent class\".\"<br>\";  \n      }  \n   }  \n   class son extends father{  \n      public function __construct(){  \n         parent::__construct();  \n         echo \"parent class is called using child\";  \n      }  \n   }  \n$obj = new son();  \n?>   \nOutput:\n\n\nCase 2: If the child class does not contain a constructor, the parent constructor can be called directly without using the same method\nExample:\n<?php  \n   class father{  \n      public function __construct(){  \n         echo \"this is the parent class\".\"<br>\";  \n      }  \n   }  \n   class son extends father{  \n        }  \n     $obj = new son();  \n?>  \nOutput:",

For instance, taking a real-life example, a class employee is a class declared around a particular employee in an organization, and all his traits, habits, salary, address, phone number, etc. will be encapsulated inside the class. And objects refer to the occurrence of the class declared.\nOOPs works on four major pillars that include\nData encapsulation: Wrapping up chunks of data under a single main title to make the development process convenient.\nData abstraction: Hiding the background working of methods and functions helps on reducing development complexity by exposing only the operation details and hiding the implementation details.\nData inheritance: Transferring important data from a parent class to a child class, which helps in reusability.\nPolymorphism - The ability of a code to have multiple inputs and a common output.",
