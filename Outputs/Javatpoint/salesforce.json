        "answer": "Salesforce is a cloud-based service. It is a customer relationship management (CRM) platform. Salesforce is a software as a Service (SaaS). It helps you to manage customer relationships, integrate with other systems, and build apps. The tool helps you to manage and create a custom solution as per your business requirement.\n\nBefore Salesforce, companies had their servers for customer relationship management (CRM). They were costly and time taking. They were very hard to use. Feasible solution to this problem is to build an affordable CRM software and delivering it entirely online as a service.\nIn a few years, there has been a significant surge in cloud computing technologies. Salesforce has an immense impact on the world of computing. Salesforce is developed as the fifth largest software company in the world. It is the top CRM service provider.\nADVERTISEMENT",

Where a party is a parent object, and people is a child object. Then if we delete party record, all the associated record will also get deleted.\n\nWhen two objects form a Master-detail relationship, we can create a unique type of field over the master object, called Roll-up summary.\nA Roll-up summary allows us to calculate values related to child record, such as the number of child record, average, sum, etc., linked to a parent record.",

        "answer": "Pagination is a technique to display a large number of records and displaying the records on multiple pages. We use pagination instead of controlling the number of records displayed on each page.\nBy default, a list controller shows 20 pages in a page. To customize it, we use a controller extension to set the Page Size.\nTake a look at the below sample code:\n<apex:page standardController=\"Salary\" recordSetVar=\"Salaries\">  \n<apex:pageBlock title=\"Viewing Salaries\">  \n<apex:form id=\"theForm\">  \n<apex:pageBlockSection >  \n<apex:dataList var=\"opp\" value=\"{!Salaries }\">  \n{!opp.Name}  \n</apex:dataList>  \n</apex:pageBlockSection>  \n<apex:panelGrid columns=\"4\">  \n<apex:commandLink action=\"{!first}\">FIRST</apex:commandLink>  \n<apex:commandLink action=\"{!next}\">NEXT</apex:commandLink>  \n<apex:commandLink action=\"{!previous}\">PREVIOUS</apex:commandLink>  \n<apex:commandLink action=\"{!last}\">LAST</apex:commandLink>  \n</apex:panelGrid>  \n   </apex:form>  \n</apex:pageBlock>  \n</apex:page>",
