        "answer": "Accounts payable or AP is an amount that a company needs to give to vendors for goods and services purchased on credit. It has to be paid off to its creditors or suppliers within a period. Accounts payable is a type of existing liability of a company.\nIn other words, we can say that accounts payable is due money which the company has to pay to the vendors or suppliers for goods or services received that have not yet been paid for. Accounts Payable is considered as a liability and comes under the head 'current liabilities'. It is a short-term debt payment that needs to be paid to avoid default.\nFor example, suppose a restaurant orders food and beverage from a company on credit to owe money to the company. These items are part of the inventory and are considered trade payables. On the other hand, the restaurant's obligations to other companies, such as the company cleaning the restaurant's staff uniforms, are considered accounts payable. Generally, both categories fall under the broader accounts payable category, and many companies combine both under the term accounts payable.",

        "question": "4) What is the difference between debenture holder and preference shareholder?",
        "answer": "Following is a list of significant differences between debenture holders and preference shareholders:\nDebenture Holder Preference Shareholder\nA person having the debentures (has owed money to a company) is called a debenture holder. A person holding the shares is called a preference shareholder. A shareholder could be considered as a partial owner of the company.\nA debenture holder needs to be paid money irrespective of the company making profits or losses. A preference shareholder earns dividends if the company is making profits.\nA debenture holder is only a creditor of the company. A preference shareholder is the joint owner of the company.\nA debenture holder earns interest on the capital invested till the capital is not returned or gets the capital invested at the end of a stipulated term. A preference shareholder is not always promised a return of the capital invested. Instead, he earns dividends till the time the company exists and is profitable.\nThe debenture holders are not invited to attend the company's annual general meeting unless any decision affecting their interest is taken. The preference shareholders are always invited to attend the annual general meeting of the company.\nThe debenture holders cannot interfere with the management and regulation of the company. The shareholders can control the affairs of the company. It is managed by the Board of Directors and the elected representatives of the shareholders.\nDebentures can be converted into shares. Shares cannot be converted into debentures.\nDebentures are generally secured and carry a charge on the assets of the company. So, the debenture holder is paid before a shareholder winding up the company. The shares don't have such a charge. So, the share capital is not returned except in the case of redeemable preference shares.",
