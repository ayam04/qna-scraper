Basically, we freeze those indices which are not in use to free up the memory.\n\nFrozen indices become read-only and its resources are no longer kept active. So, these indices are searchable, but to write again, we have to unfreeze them. Elasticsearch offers an ignore_throttled parameter, which is used to include the frozen indices in your search.
