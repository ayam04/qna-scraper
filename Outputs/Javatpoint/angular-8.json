The observables can handle a sequence of asynchronous events over a period of time.\nPromises are always asynchronous. Observables are both synchronous as well as asynchronous.\nPromises generally provide only a single value. Observables can emit multiple values.\nPromises are not lazy. They can execute immediately after creation. Observables are very lazy. They can't be executed until you subscribe to them using the subscribe() method.\nPromises are not cancellable. Observables have subscriptions that can be canceled using the unsubscribe() method. After that, they stop the listener from receiving further values.\nPromises don't provide any operations. Observables provide the map for forEach, filter, reduce, retry, and retryWhen operators.\nPromises push errors to the child promises. Observables deliver errors to subscribers.",

It is used to make a communication between the DOM and the TypeScript code of your component. In simple words, you can say that data binding is a communication between the typescript code of your component and your template, which the user sees. It makes it easy to define interactive applications without worrying about pushing and pulling data.\nThere are two types of data binding i.e., one-way data binding, two-way data binding.",

        "question": "30) What is the use of reactive forms in Angular 8?",
        "answer": "Reactive forms use a model-driven approach to handle form inputs where values constantly change over time. It uses an explicit and immutable approach to manage the state of a form at a specific time. Every time the changes occur to the form state, it returns a new state. The reactive forms are used mainly for the following features:\nReactive forms are more robust than template-driven forms.\nReactive forms are more scalable, reusable, and testable.\nReactive forms are preferred to use when the forms are a key part of the application, or the application is already built using reactive patterns.

        "answer": "Following are the benefits of using Template-driven forms:\nYou should use Template-driven forms if you want to add a simple form to your application because template-driven forms use two-way data binding to update the data model in the component. By using this, you can see the changes instantly as you make changes in the template and vice versa.\nTemplate-driven forms are easy to use in the application, but they are not as scalable as Reactive forms, so they are preferred to use in test applications for learning purposes.\nTemplate-driven forms are mainly used if your application requires a very basic form and logic.

Here, we have compared both forms to see the differences:\nReactive Forms Template-driven forms\nReactive forms are more robust, so they are best to use. Template-driven forms are best if you want to add a simple form to your application. For example email list signup form.\nReactive forms are more scalable, reusable, and testable, so they are preferred to use in professional websites for the industry.

        "answer": "Angular Universal is a technology that is used to render Angular applications on the server. This process is called SSR (server-side rendering). A simple Angular application is executed on the browser as all the Angular applications are single-page applications, so the rendering always occurs on the browser. This process of rendering single-page applications is called the client-side rendering process (CSR). On the other hand, the Angular Universal is executed on the server, generating static application pages that later get bootstrapped on the client. That's why Angular Universal application generally renders more quickly, giving users a chance to view the application layout before it becomes fully interactive.",

        "answer": "In Angular 8, AOT stands for Ahead-of-Time compiler. It pre-compiles the application components and their templates during the build process.\nThere are several reasons why apps compiled with AOT launch faster:\nThe application components that are compiled with AOT execute immediately, without client-side compilation.\nHere, templates are embedded as code within their components, so there is no client-side request for template files. That's why it is fast.\nThe compiler doesn't entertain the unused Angular directives. It's also a reason for its fast response.",
