It is the most widely used language over the internet. XHTML is an acronym that stands for Extensible Hypertext Markup Language.\nHTML is a language used to create web pages and link them from one to another. XHTML is considered a part of the XML markup language. It contains the features of both XML and HTML.\nTim Berners-Lee developed HTML in 1991. XHTML was developed by W3C, i.e., World Wide Web Consortium, and was released in 2000.\nHTML is extended from SGML and follows the format of document file format. XHTML is extended from XML and HTML and follows the markup language format.\nIn HTML, it is not necessary to write Doctype at the top. In XHTML, you must write Doctype at the top of the file.\nHTML is not strictly case-sensitive. It is not necessary to put all tags in lower or upper case. XHTML is strictly case-sensitive. Here, you have to put every tag and attribute in lower case.\nIn HTML, it is not necessary to close the tags in the order they are opened. In XHTML, you must close the tags in the order they are opened.\nHTML is an older language for linking web pages on the internet. In comparison, XHTML is called a better version of HTML.\nIn HTML, it is not necessary to mention quotes while using attributes. For example: <JavaTpoint>. In XHTML, it is mandatory to mention quotes while using attributes. For example: <JavaTpoint=\"JTP\">.\nIn HTML, filename extensions are used as \".html\", and \".htm\". In XHTML, filename extensions are used as \".xhtml\", \".xht\", \".xml\".",

These are small files that often include unique identifiers that web servers send to browsers. When a browser requests a new page every time, these cookies can be sent back to the server.\nSession storage: Session storage is a popular choice for storing data on a browser. The session storage property facilitates developers to save and retrieve different values. This property allows applications to store data until the window is closed.\nLocal storage: The local storage property allows developers to store data without expiration. The key difference between local storage and session storage is that the session storage only keeps data for a particular session, and the data is cleared once the user closes the browser window. On the other hand, the local storage property allows applications to store data without an end.",

Semantic HTML is processed by traditional web browsers and many other user agents. It is used to emphasize the content's semantics or meaning.\nThe tags are different in semantic HTML as compared to normal HTML. For example, the <b></b> tag is not used for bold statements in semantic HTML, and the <i></i> element is for italic. Instead, we use the <strong></strong> tags and <em></em> tags respectively.",

        "answer": "Git merge, and Git rebase are both used to integrate changes from one branch into another. Git rebase moves a feature branch into a master while the Git merge adds a new commit, preserving the history.\nAccording to the official Git manual, the Git Rebase \"reapplies commits on top of another base branch\". On the other hand, Git merge \"joins two or more development histories together\". In other words, we can see that the Git merge preserves history as it happened, while the Git rebase rewrites it.\nFor example, if you are working on a new feature in a dedicated branch, and another team member pushes new commits to the master branch, the Git merge will incorporate new commits into your feature branch. Every time you need to include modifications, you would require an extra merging commit. On the other hand, in Git rebase, you can rebase the feature branch into master instead of merging it. This includes all the new commits in the master branch and rewrites the project history by creating brand new commits for each one in the original branch.",

        "answer": "Lazy loading is a design pattern and optimization technique used in computer programming to delay the initialization of an object until a required period. It is also known as on-demand loading. This optimization technique is used for online content like a website or a web app. It is used to enhance the performance of the web page. In this technique, instead of loading the entire web page and rendering it to the user in one go as in bulk loading, only the required section is loaded, and it delays the remaining part of the web page until the user requires it.\nAdvantages of Lazy loading\nLazy loading or on-demand loading enhances the performance of web pages by reducing time consumption and memory usage.\nIt optimizes the content delivery on the web page.\nIt loads only a fraction of the web page first, which is required. Thus, the time taken is less, and the loading of the rest of the part of the web page is delayed, which saves storage.\nIt enhances the user's experience as the requested content is delivered quickly.\nIt avoids unnecessary code execution.\nIt is cost-effective as it practices the optimal time and space resources usage.\nDisadvantages of Lazy loading\nThe developers have to add some extra lines of code to the existing ones to implement lazy load. It can make the code a bit complicated.\nSometimes, lazy loading may affect the website's ranking on search engines because of improper indexing of the content, which is not loaded.",

        "answer": "Tags and attributes are two concepts used in HTML. They work together but perform different functions. The main difference between an HTML tag and an HTML attribute is that an HTML tag is a way of representing an HTML element in the program. On the other hand, an HTML attribute describes the characteristics of an HTML element. For example, <a>, <href>, <button>, and <div> etc. are HTML tags and src, class, and id etc. are the example of HTML attributes.\nSee this example:\n<img src=\"myhome.jpg\" alt=\"A photo of my home.\">  \nIn the above example, the image source (src) and the alt text (alt) are attributes of the <img> tag.\nDifference between HTML tags and HTML attributes\nHTML Tags HTML Attributes\nHTML tags are generally the starting and ending parts of the HTML code. HTML attributes are used to define the character of the HTML elements.\nHTML tags define a way to represent and hold HTML elements in the program. HTML attributes are generally used to provide additional styling to the element.\nHTML tags begin with < symbol and end with > symbol.

Let us see the differences between the inline and block elements in HTML:\nBlock Elements: Block elements are types of blocks that contain many elements in a line itself. They consider top and bottom margins and don't contain any other elements next to them. They consume the full width available and always start in a new line.\nExamples of Block elements:\n<h1>-<h6>: These elements include headings of different sizes ranging from 1 to 6. Here, the smaller the number, the bigger the heading size.\n<div>: This element is used to make separate content divisions on the web page.\n<li>: This block element includes list items of an ordered or unordered list.\n<ul>: This block element is used to make an unordered list.\n<ol>: This block element is used to make an ordered list.\n<hr>: This block element is an empty tag used to separate content by horizontal lines.\n<p>: This block element includes paragraphs of content in the webpage.\n<table>: This block element includes the tables in the web page when it requires tabular data.\nHTML 5 Semantic block elements:\n<header>: This semantic block element includes all the main things of the webpage like navbar, logos, and heading of the webpage.\n<nav>: This semantic block element helps navigate different sections by including different blocks of hyperlinks in the webpage.\n<footer>: This semantic block element contains all information about the web page's authorization, contact, and copyright details.\n<main>: This semantic block element is used to specify the main content of the webpage.\n<section>: This semantic block element is used to specify separate different sections in the webpage.\n<article>: This semantic block element includes different independent articles on the webpage.\n<aside>: This semantic block element mentions details of the main content aside.\nInline Elements: Inline elements take up only enough width that is sufficient to them and allow other elements next to it inline. They do not have top and bottom margins as block elements have only the left and right and consider the padding.\nExamples of Inline elements:\n<a>: This inline element includes hyperlinks in the webpage.\n<br>: This inline element mentions line breaks in the webpage where ever needed.\n<script>: This inline element is used to include external and internal JavaScript codes.\n<input>: This inline element accepts input from the users and is mainly used in forms.\n<img>: This inline element includes different images in the webpage to add beauty to the webpage.\n<span>: This inline element is an inline container that takes necessary space only.\n<b>: This inline element is used in places where bold text is needed.\n<label>: This inline element provides a usability improvement for mouse users, i.e., if a user clicks on the text within the <label> element, it toggles the control.",
