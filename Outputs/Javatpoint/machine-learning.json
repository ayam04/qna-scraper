        "question": "2) Differentiate between inductive learning and deductive learning?",
        "answer": "In inductive learning, the model learns by examples from a set of observed instances to draw a generalized conclusion. On the other side, in deductive learning, the model first applies the conclusion, and then the conclusion is drawn.\nADVERTISEMENT\nInductive learning is the method of using observations to draw conclusions.\nDeductive learning is the method of using conclusions to form observations.\nFor example, if we have to explain to a kid that playing with fire can cause burns. There are two ways we can explain this to a kid; we can show training examples of various fire accidents or images of burnt people and label them as \"Hazardous\". In this case, a kid will understand with the help of examples and not play with the fire. It is the form of Inductive machine learning. The other way to teach the same thing is to let the kid play with the fire and wait to see what happens. If the kid gets a burn, it will teach the kid not to play with fire and avoid going near it. It is the form of deductive learning.",

It means that the elements can be accessed directly using their index value, like arr[0] for 1st element, arr[5] for 6th element, etc.\nAs a result, accessing elements in an array is fast with constant time complexity of O(1).\nLinked List supports Sequential Access. It means that we have to traverse the complete linked list, up to that element sequentially which element/node we want to access in a linked list.\nTo access the nth element of a linked list, the time complexity is O(n).\nMemory is allocated at compile time as soon as the array is declared. It is known as Static Memory Allocation.\nMemory is allocated at runtime, whenever a new node is added. It is known as Dynamic Memory Allocation.\nInsertion and Deletion operation takes more time in the array, as the memory locations are consecutive and fixed.\nIn case of a linked list, a new element is stored at the first free available memory location.\nThus, Insertion and Deletion operations are fast in the linked list.\nSize of the array must be declared at the time of array declaration.\nSize of a Linked list is variable.
