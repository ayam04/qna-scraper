        "question": "1) What is API?",
        "answer": "API (Application Programming Interface) helps in communication and data exchange between two software systems. API act as an interface between two applications and allows the two software systems communicate with one another. API is a collection of functions which can be executed by another software program.\nAPI works as; it takes a request from the source, takes that request to the database, fetches the request data from the database and returns a response to the source. API takes the requests from the user and gives the response without exposing the internal details. API acts as Abstraction.\nExample: Amazon API, Google Map API",

    {
        "question": "2) What is API testing?",
        "answer": "API testing is a type of software testing that involves testing APIs directly. API is a part of integration testing to check whether the API meets expectations in terms of functionality, reliability, performance, and security of applications. Multiple API system can performed API testing. In API testing, our primary focus is on Business Logic Layer of the software architecture.",

    },
    {
        "question": "9) What are the advantages of API testing?",
        "answer": "Advantages of API testing are:\nTest for core functionality: API testing provides access to the application without the user interface. The core functionality of the application will be tested before the GUI tests. This will help to detect the minor issue which can become bigger during the GUI testing.\nTime effective: API testing is less time consuming than GUI testing. Particularly, API test requires less code so it can provide better and faster test coverage compare to GUI test automation. This will reduce the cost for the testing project.\nLanguage Independent: In API testing data is exchange using XML or JSON. These transfer mode are completely language-independent, which allows users to select any code language when adopting automation test service for the project.\nEasy Integration with GUI: API tests provide highly integrable tests which is useful to perform functional GUI tests after GUI tests. Simple integration would allow new user accounts to be created within the application before GUI started.",

    },
    {
        "question": "10) What are the principles of an API test design?",
        "answer": "Here, are the seven principles of API test design.\nExhaustive Testing: Exhaustive testing is not possible. Instead we need optimal amount of testing which is based on the risk assessment of the application.\nDefect Clustering: Defect Clustering states that a small number of modules contain the most of the defect detected. Approximately 80% of the defect found in 20% of the modules. By experience we can identify such risky modules. But this approach has its own problems. If the same tests are repeated over and over again, eventually the same test case will no longer find new bugs.\nPesticide Paradox: Testers cannot depend on existing technique. They must have to look continually to improve the existing method to make testing more effective. But even all these hard work in testing we can never claim our product is bug free. To overcome this, test cases need to be regularly reviewed and revised add new and different test cases to help find more defects.\nTesting shows presence of defects: Testing principle states that- testing talks about the presence of defects not about the absence of defect. Software testing reduces the probability of undiscovered defects remaining in the software but even if no defects found, it is not a proof of correctness.\nBut if we work hard, taking all precautions and make our software products 99% bug free. The software does not meet the needs and requirements of the client.\nAbsence of error -fallacy: This can be possible the software which is 99% bug free is still unusable. The case can be if the system is tested for the wrong requirement. Software testing is not finding the defects but also to check that software addresses the business needs. The absence of error is fallacy i.e. finding and fixing defects does not help if the system build is unusable and doesn't fulfill the user's needs and requirements.\nEarly Testing: Testing should start as soon as possible in the software development lifecycle. So that defects in the requirement or design phase captured in the early stages. It is cheaper to fix defect in the early stages of testing. We should start finding the bug at the moment the requirements are defined.\nTesting is context dependent: Testing is context dependent that we test an e-commerce site will be different from the way we test the commercial. All the developed software's are not identical. We will use different methodology; techniques and type of testing depend on the application type.",

        "question": "11) What is API framework?",
        "answer": "A framework or software framework is a platform for developing software applications. API framework is a foundation on which software developer can build applications for a specific platform.\nExample: A framework can include predefined classes and functions that can be used to process input, manage hardware devices and interact with system software.\nFramework is similar to an Application Programming Interface, technically framework includes API. Framework serves foundation for programming while API provides access to the elements supported by the framework. Framework also includes code libraries, compiler and other programs used in the software development process.\nAPI framework is defined by configuration file which consists the list of all APIs that is required to be activated and activated for a particular program run.",

        "answer": "Here, are the common tests that performed on API are as:\nResponse of the API should be verified based on the request. We will verify that the return value is based on request.\nWhen API is updating any data structure we should verify the system is authenticating the outcome.\nWe will verify whether the API is trigger other event or request another API.\nWe will verify the behavior of the API when no value is return.",
