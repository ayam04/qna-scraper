        "answer": "IIS is an acronym that stands for Internet Information Server. It is one of the most popular web servers developed by Microsoft and is used to host and provide Internet-based services to ASP.NET and ASP web applications.\nIIS is mainly used to respond to the requests that come from users. When a user sends a request to the server, IIS takes that request from the user, processes it, and sends the response back to the user. IIS consists of its own ASP.NET process engine to handle the ASP.NET request. We can configure an ASP.NET application according to the version of IIS the application is running on.\nIIS is the most used HTTP server in the world, which runs on Windows.",

IIS can support the following Protocols HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SMTP Etc. The websites hosted on the IIS get the request from the clients. When the client sends the request, it first hits the IIS Server, and then the server passes it to the ASP.NET worker process to execute the request. After that, the response is passed to the client via IIS itself.",

        "question": "12) What is a web farm in IIS? What are its advantages?",
        "answer": "In IIS, a web farm is a process of hosting web applications on multiple web servers using a load balancer. It is a group of two or more web servers/nodes that host multiple instances of an app. It provides a load balancer method to avoid the high load on a single server and distributes the traffic to a different server on the same web application. When a user sends a request to a web farm, the load balancer distributes the requests to the web farm's nodes to prevent the high load on a single server.\n\nA web farm provides the following advantages:\nAvailability & Reliability: A web farm is a group of two or more nodes that host multiple instances of an app. When one or more nodes fail, the load balancer can route the users' requests to other functioning nodes to continue the request processing. This is how it provides great availability and reliability.\nHigh performance: In a web farm, there are multiple nodes to process more requests than a single server. The load balancer balances the workload by distributing requests to the nodes. It provides high performance.\nScalability: It can increase or decrease the number of active nodes according to the workload required capacity. There are several web farm platform technologies, such as Azure App Service, that can automatically add or remove nodes at the system administrator's request or automatically without human intervention.\nMaintainability: It makes the system management easy as a web farm's nodes can rely on shared services. For example, the nodes of a web farm can rely upon a single database server and a common network location for static resources.",

        "answer": "A web farm is a web hosting system which consists of multiple web servers for multiple clients. This is mainly used to prevent traffic and allow smooth availability of resources to all the clients. So we can say a web farm is used while hosting a single web application on multiple web servers to distribute the load among them. On the other hand, a web garden is a hosting web system where an application pool is configured while specifying the number of worker processes. It is mainly used for hosting multiple processes on a single web server. Let's see the key differences between a web farm and a web garden in the following table:\nWeb Farm Web Garden\nWeb form provides the ability to run across multiple servers. Web garden has a single server on which we can run multiple numbers of processes.\nIt is used to provide physical scalability to web applications. It is used to provide logical scalability to web applications.\nIt includes multiple computers to run multiple processes. It includes multiple processes to run on a single server.\nIt is preferred because it improves performance. It is preferred because it requires less amount of physical space.\nIt uses a load balancer to group together multiple web servers. It requires aMachine.Configfile to group together multiple web servers.\nIt provides high availability as compared to a web garden. It provides better application availability as compared to a web form.\nWe can achieve it by using a load balancer with virtual IP. We can achieve it by enabling multiple worker processes for a single application pool.",

An application pool is mainly used to separate sets of IIS worker processes that share the same configuration and application boundaries. It is done to achieve better security, reliability, scalability, availability and performance and keep running without impacting each other. The worker process serves as the process boundary that separates each application pool.
