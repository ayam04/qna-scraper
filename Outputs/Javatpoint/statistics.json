        "answer": "Statistics is a discipline that concerns the study of collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. Statistics study is generally used in scientific, industrial, and social problems to understand the statistical population or a statistical model of the related data. For example, to get the population statistics, we can use diverse it into the groups of people or objects such as \"all people living in a country\".\nStatistics is the study of every aspect of data, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments.",

        "question": "2) What are the different types of Statistics?",
        "answer": "There are mainly two types of Statistics:\nADVERTISEMENT\nDescriptive statistics\nInferential statistics\nDescriptive Statistics\nDescriptive statistics is a type of statistics where data is summarized through the given observations. The summarization is done from a population sample using parameters such as the mean or standard deviation. Descriptive statistics provides a way to organize, represent and describe a collection of data using tables, graphs, and summary measures. For example, a collection of people in a city using specific services such as the internet or television channels.\nThe descriptive statistics can be categorized into the following four different categories:\nMeasure of frequency\nMeasure of position\nMeasure of dispersion\nA measure of central tendency\nInferential Statistics\nInferential statistics is a type of statistics used to interpret the meaning of descriptive statistics. These statistics are used to conclude the data that depends on random variations such as observational errors, sampling variation, etc. Once we have collected, analyzed, and summarized the data, we use these statistics to describe the meaning of the collected data.\nIn this method, we use the information collected from a sample to make decisions, predictions, or inferences from a population. It also facilitates us to give statements that go beyond the available data or information.",

        "answer": "In general, people often use the terms \"data\" and \"statistics\" interchangeably, but there is a key difference between them. Data can be specified as the individual pieces of factual information recorded and used for analysis. In other terms, data is raw information from which statistics are created. On the other hand, statistics are the results of data analysis, its interpretation, and presentation.\nIn other words, we can say that statistics is a process of some computation to provide some understanding of what the data means. Statistics are generally presented in the form of a table, chart, or graph. For research purposes, we require both statistics and data frequently. Statistics are often reported and used by government agencies. For example, unemployment statistics, educational literacy statistics, etc. These types of statistics are called \"statistical data\".",

        "question": "5) What are the four different types of data statistics?",
        "answer": "Data statistics can be divided into mainly two categories:\nQualitative data\nQuantitative data\nLater, these can be subdivided into 4 types of data where nominal data and ordinal data come under qualitative data, and interval and ratio data come under quantitative data.\nQualitative data: Qualitative data is a set of information that cannot be measured in the form of numbers. It is also called categorical data. It normally contains words, narratives, etc., that we label with names. It mainly focuses on the qualities of things in data, and after the qualitative data analysis, the outcome comes in featuring keywords, extracting data, and ideas elaboration.\nFor example, a person's hair color such as black, brown, red, blonde, etc. The qualitative data can be divided into two subcategories: nominal and ordinal.\nNominal Data: The nominal data are used to label variables with no quantitative value and no order. It doesn't change the meaning if you change the order of the value, and after that meaning will remain the same. So, you can only observe the nominal data and can't measure.\nOrdinal Data: The ordinal data is very much similar to the nominal data but not in the case of an order. The ordinal data is ordered, and their categories can be ordered like 1st, 2nd, etc.",

        "question": "6) What is the Central Limit Theorem? Why is it used?",
        "answer": "Central Limit Theorem is the most important part of statistics. It specifies that the distribution of a sample from a population that consists of large sample size will have its mean normally distributed. In other words, we can say that it will not affect the original population distribution even if the sample size gets larger, regardless of the population's distribution. Generally, it is considered sufficient for the CLT to hold if the sample sizes are equal to or more than 30.\nCentral Limit Theorem or CTL is mainly used to calculate confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. It also facilitates us to calculate the confidence intervals accurately. For example, if you want to calculate the average height of the people in the world, you have to take some samples from the general population, which serves as the data set. Here, it is very difficult or nearly impossible to get data regarding the height of every person in the world, so you have to calculate the mean of your sample data.\nBy multiplying the get data set several times, you will get the mean and their frequencies which you can plot on the graph and create a normal distribution curve. Here, you will get a bell-shaped curve that closely resembles the original data set.",

Once the p-value is calculated, the null hypothesis is assumed true, and the values are determined. To ensure the value's correctness, we compare it with the alpha value, which denotes the significance, which is tweaked. If the p-value is less than the alpha value, the null hypothesis is rejected, otherwise considered. This is used to ensure that the result obtained is statistically significant.",

In Hypothesis Testing, the first thing is to know the null hypothesis and then specify it. After that, the p-value is calculated, and if the null hypothesis is true, the other values are also determined. The alpha value specifies the significance, and you can adjust it accordingly.\nIf the p-value is less than the alpha value, the null hypothesis is rejected, but the null hypothesis is accepted if the p-value is greater than the alpha value.

Mean imputation is considered bad practice because it completely removes the accountability for feature correlation.

The main use of the p-value is to test the validity of the Null Hypothesis.

P-value allows us to determine whether the provided results are caused by chance or whether we are testing two unrelated things.
