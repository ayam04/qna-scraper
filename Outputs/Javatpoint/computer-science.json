It is called a mid-level programming language as it combines both a low-level programming language and a high-level programming language. C programming language is mainly used to design applications such as Text Editors, Compilers, Network devices, etc.\nJava Programming Language: Java is a simple, secure, reliable, platform-independent, architecture-neutral, high-level programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995. Java is mainly used to develop banking software, retail software, information technology, android, big data, the research community, web and desktop applications, etc. Now, Java is owned by Oracle.\nPython Programming Language: It is an open-source and easy-to-learn programming language developed in the 1990s. Python is one of the most widely used user-friendly programming languages and is mostly used in Machine learning, Artificial intelligence, Big Data, GUI-based desktop applications, and Robotics.\nC++ Language: It is pronounced as C plus plus. It is one of the thousands of programming languages we use to develop software. Bjarne Stroustrup developed the C++ programming language in 1980. It is similar to the C programming language but also includes additional features such as exception handling, object-oriented programming, type checking, etc.\nC# Programming Language: It is pronounced as C sharp. It is a modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language used with XML-based Web services on the .NET platform. It is mainly designed to improve productivity in web applications. It is easier to learn for those users who have sufficient knowledge of common programming languages like C, C++, or Java.\nJavaScript Language: It is a scripting language used on both the client-side and a server-side. It is developed in the 1990s for the Netscape Navigator web browser. It allows programmers to implement complex features to make web pages alive. It helps programmers create dynamic websites, servers, mobile applications, animated graphics, games, and more.\nPHP Programming Language: PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor. It is an open-source, powerful server-side scripting language mainly used to create static and dynamic websites. Rasmus Laird developed it in 1994.

        "question": "11) What is a constructor in an object-oriented programming language?",
        "answer": "In a class-based object-oriented programming language, a constructor is a special method in the class that is automatically called when the object of that class is created. The constructors have the same name as the class, and they usually initialize the data members of the new object. A constructor is very similar to an instance method, but the difference between the constructor and the method is that the constructor has no explicit return type, it is not implicitly inherited, and it usually has different rules for scope modifiers.\nIf you do not write a constructor in your program, the first thing the object does when it is created is that it looks for a constructor. Java automatically creates a default constructor and calls it if it doesn't find the constructor.\nHere, we are talking about Java (A popular object-oriented programming language). Let's take an example to understand it well. There are two rules to write a constructor:\nClass name and Constructor name should be the same.\nIt should not have any return type.\n\nExample:\nSuppose we have a class named Vehicle.java. It is a java class that only has a constructor in it. Here, we must remember that there is no return type, and the name should match the class name.\nVehicle.java\n// Vehicle.java   \npublic class Vehicle{   \n    public Vehicle(){   \n        System.out.println(\"This is an example of default constructor\");   \n    }   \n}   \nMain.java  \n// Main.java   \npublic class Main{   \n    public static void main(String[] args){   \n        Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle();   \n        //when vehicle object is created, it directly calls Vehicle()   \n        //constructor   \n    }   \n}   \nOutput:\nThis is an example of a default constructor",

        "question": "13) What are the different OOPs principles in Java?",
        "answer": "Every Object-oriented programming language follows the principle of OOPs. OOPs is an acronym that stands for Object-Oriented Programming System. In Java programming language, the basic OOPs principles are as follows:\nInheritance\nPolymorphism\nAbstraction\nEncapsulation\nBefore learning the core principles of OOPs, we must learn about the basic concepts of Object-Oriented programming language. Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. Here, an object is an entity that has a state and behavior. For example, a chair, table, laptop, bike, pen, pencil, keyboard, etc., are examples of an object. It can be physical or logical. We can define an object as an instance of a class. An object contains an address and takes up some space in memory.\nExample: A cow is an object because it has states like color, name, breed, etc., and behaviors giving milk, eating, etc.\nOn the other hand, a class is the collection of objects. It is a logical entity. We can define a class as a blueprint from which we can create an individual object. Class doesn't consume any space.\nInheritance\nIn Java, Inheritance is the procedure in which one class inherits or acquires all the properties and behaviors of another class. The class whose properties and methods are inherited is called the parent class, and the class which inherits the properties and behaviors is called the child class. Inheritance is used to achieve runtime polymorphism. It also provides code reusability.\nPolymorphism\nPolymorphism is one of the most important concepts of object-oriented programming language. Polymorphism is the ability to perform a task differently or process data in more than one form. The word \"Polymorphism\" is made of two words poly and morphism. Here, poly means many, and morphism means types. In Java, method overloading and method overriding are used to achieve polymorphism.\nAbstraction\nAbstraction is a process of hiding internal details and showing functionalities only. It shows only essential attributes and hides unnecessary information from the users. For example, a phone call; here, the users don't know about the internal processing.\nEncapsulation\nEncapsulation is a process of binding or wrapping up data together into a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. In other words, we can say that encapsulation acts as a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield. A java class is an example of encapsulation.",

For example, a framework can have predetermined classes as well as functions.\nFrameworks are often built, tested, and optimized by several experienced software engineers, programmers, and web developers. That is why software frameworks are versatile, robust, and efficient. If you use a software framework to develop applications, it facilitates you to focus on the high-level functionality of the application.

C++ is called hybrid language because it supports procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms.\nThere are 32 keywords in the C programming language. There are 63 keywords in the C++ programming language.\nC language does not support information hiding. In C++, data is hidden by Encapsulation to ensure that data structures and operators are used as intended.\nC supports only built-in data types. C++ supports built-in as well as user-defined data types.\nC is a procedural programming language, so data and functions are separated. C++ is an object-oriented programming language, so data and functions are encapsulated together in the form of an object in C++.\nC is a procedural programming language, and it is also a function-driven language. C++ is an object-oriented programming language, so it is also called an object-driven language.\nC language does not support function and operator overloading. C++ language supports function and operator overloading.\nC language is a function-driven language. C++ language is an object-driven language.\nIn C language, functions cannot be defined inside structures. In C++, functions can be used inside a structure.\nC does not support Namespace features.

Interpreters are best suited for the program and development environment.\nCompilers are preferred for their less execution time. Interpreters are slow in executing the object code, so they are less preferred.\nCompilers convert the source code into object code. Interpreters do not convert source code into object code; instead, they scan it line by line.\nCompilers don't require source code for later execution. Interpreters require source code for later execution.\nThe target program executes independently in compilation, so it does not require the compiler in the memory.

On the other hand, secondary memory refers to the external storage device that can be used to store data or information permanently. Both memories are used to serve the same purpose but act differently. Let's see the key differences between them:\nPrimary memory Secondary memory\nPrimary memory is the main memory that can be directly accessed by the Central Processing Unit (CPU). Secondary memory is first transferred to the primary memory and then accessed by the processor because the processor does not directly interact with the secondary memory.\nPrimary memory stores temporary information until the process finishes its execution. Secondary memory is used to store data or information permanently. It is an external storage device.\nThe nature of Primary memory varies accordingly. For RAM, it is volatile. For ROM, it is Non-volatile. Secondary memory is always Non-volatile.\nSemiconductor memory devices are used for primary memory. Magnetic and optical memory devices are used in secondary memory.\nPrimary memory devices are more expensive than secondary storage devices. Secondary memory devices are not as much expensive as primary memory devices.\nPrimary memory is also called Main memory or Internal memory.
