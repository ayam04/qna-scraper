        "answer": "In bubble sort technique the list is split into two sub-lists sorted and unsorted. The smallest component is bubbled from unsorted sub-list. After moving the smallest component, the imaginary wall moves one element ahead. The bubble sort was initially written to bubble up the highest item in the list. But there is no difference whether the highest / lowest item is bubbled. This technique is simple to understand but time-consuming. In this type, two successive components are compared, and swapping is done. Thus, step-by-step entire array items are checked, given a list of 'n' elements the bubble sort needed up to n-1 passes to sort the record.\nRead More",

And the wall moves one item ahead, as the sorted file is increases and an unsorted file is decreased.\nAssume that we have a file on n elements. By applying a selection sort, the first item is compared with all remaining (n-1) elements. The smallest item is placed at the first location. Again, the second item is compared with the remaining (n-1) elements. At the time of the comparison, the smaller item is swapped with a bigger item. Similarly, the entire array is checked for smallest component, and then swapping is done accordingly. Here we need n-1 passes or repetition to rearrange the data completely.\nRead More",

Once the pivot is selected, then it shifts all the components less than pivot to the left of value pivot, and all the items higher than the pivot are shifted to the right side.

In this technique, the array is searched for the required item from the starting of the list/array or the last component to the first component of the array and continues until the element is found or the entire list/array has been searched.\nAdvantages\nIt is an easy and conventional technique of searching for information. The linear or sequential name implies which the elements are stored in a systematic manner.\nThe item in the list can be in any order. i.e., the linear search can be tested on the sorted or unsorted linear data structure.\nDisadvantages\nThis procedure is insufficient when a large number of item is present in the list.\nIt consumes more time and decreases the retrieval rate of the system.\nTime complexity: O(n)",

        "answer": "Binary search is higher than the linear search. However, it cannot be tested on the unsorted data structure. The binary search is based on the method divide-and-conquer. The binary search begins by testing the data in the middle component of the array. This determines an object is whether in the first half or second half. If the object is in the first half, we do not need to check the second half and if it is in the second half no need to check in first half. Similarly, we repeat this procedure until we find an object in the list or not found from the list. Here we need three variables to identify first, last, and middle elements.\nTo implement a binary search technique, the item must be in sorted order.\nBinary Search is performed as follows:\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe key is compared with an element in the middle position of an array\nIf the key matches with an element, return it, and stop.\nIf the key is less than mid position element, then the element to be found must be in the first half of the array, otherwise it must be in the second half of the array.\nRepeat the method for lower (or upper half) of the array until the component is found.\nRead More",

The amount of time needed to lookup an item in the array is either O(log n) or O(n) based on whether the array is sorted or not. If the array is sorted, then a procedure such as a binary search can be used to search the array. Otherwise, the array must be searched linearly. Either method may not be desirable if we need to process a very high data set. Therefore we discuss a new procedure called hashing that allows us to update and fetch any entry in constant time O(1). The constant time or O(1) performance defines the amount of time to operate does not depend on data size n.\nRead More",
