        "question": "3) What is Functional Programming in Java?",
        "answer": "Java supports functional programming. Since Java 8, we can use Lambda expression for functional programming. We can also use code to declare the functional paradigm.\nFunctional programming is a programming approach in which computations can be coded as functions. These functions are mathematical functions called the lambda function.\nThe functional programming is declarative, which means we do not need to describe the control flow of a computation logic.\nThe below program implements the functional programming in Java using a lambda expression:\nTest.java:\n//Java program to demonstrate the functional programming  \nimport java.util.Arrays;  \nimport java.util.List;  \npublic class Test {  \n    public static void main(String[] args)  \n    {  \n        Runnable r  \n            = ()  \n            -> System.out.println(  \n                \"In Runnable thread\");  \n        r.run();  \n        System.out.println(  \n            \"In main thread\");  \n    }  \n}  \nOutput:\nIn Runnable thread\nIn main thread\nIn the above program, we have achieved the functional programming using Java 8. we can also do the same by using the anonymous method.\nWe have evaluated a function and assigned it to a runnable interface. Now, this function has been treated as a first-class citizen. So this is the basic concept of functional programming.",

        "question": "4) Explain the difference between JDBC and Hibernate",
        "answer": "The JDBC ( Java Database Connectivity) is a programming interface that creates a connection between Java application and database. It establishes a link between the Java program and database so that we can send the data from the Java code and store it in our database.\nHibernate is an open-source ORM (Object Relational Mapping) framework. It allows us to develop the objects which are independent of the database tool and creates independent persistence logic. Basically, It simplifies the interaction process between Java applications and databases. It implements JPA(Java Persistence API).",

        "answer": "The following are the elements of Hibernate Architecture:\nSessionFactory\nSession\nTransaction\nConnectionProvider\nTransactionFactory\nSessionFactory\nThe SessionFactory holds the session objects. It contains the second-level data cache( optional). It uses the org.hibernate.SessionFactory interface to provide a factory method to access the session object.\nSession\nThe session object acts as a medium between the application and database. It provides an interface to the application to access the stored data from the database.\n\nThe session object is a short-lived object and encloses the JDBC connection. It is a factory of the different elements of the session such as Query, transaction, criteria. It holds the first-level data cache (mandatory).\nThe org.hibernate.Session interface provides methods to insert, update and delete the object. Furthermore, it provides factory methods for Transaction, Query, and Criteria.\nTransaction\nThe transaction objects contain the atomic unit of the tasks. It is an optional element. The org.hibernate.Transaction interface provides methods for transaction management.\nConnectionProvider\nThe ConnectionProvider provides JDBC connections. It is an optional element. It abstracts the application from DriverManager or DataSource.\nTransactionFactory\nThe TransactionFactory is an optional element. It holds the transaction objects.",

        "answer": "The Deadlock is a situation when multiple requests are tried to acquire its lock. To prevent the database from going into this state, we will make a queue to verify each request before forwarding it to the database.\nBesides the above mention strategy, we can also follow the below strategies:\nWe can avoid the database deadlock by using fewer cursors to avoid locking the tables.\nBy using a small transaction",

Lambda expressions are much similar to methods; the difference between methods and Lambda Expression is that we do not need to write its name; instead, we can implement them right in a method's body.\nThe basic syntaxes for the lambda expression are as follows:\nparameter -> expression  \n(parameter1, parameter2) -> expression",

        "question": "13) What are the Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)?",
        "answer": "The RPC or remote procedure calls are the interprocess communication technique that is used in client-based web applications. They are also known as subroutine calls or function calls.\nWhen a client made a request, RPC translates it and sends it to the server. Usually, these requests are function calls or a procedure to the remote server. When the server gets a request, it responds back to the client; the client is blocked during this process, only resumed when the server completes its execution.",

        "question": "",
        "answer": "The TCP/IP model was developed to provide efficient and accurate data transmission between devices. It breaks a message into several small packets to avoid transmission failure in a long size file. In case it encounters a problem during the transmission, it will start sending the packets again from where they break and reassembles the packets at the destination port. Every route can take a different route to reach the destination. Thus, it provides a secure and uninterrupted data transmission.\nRead more about the TCP/IP protocol.",
