        "answer": "The OSI model's architecture consists of the seven layers that work collaboratively to transmit the data from one person to another across the globe.\n\nFollowing is the list of all seven layers of the OSI model:\nPhysical Layer: The physical layer is the lowest layer of the OSI reference model. It is responsible for the actual physical connection between the devices. This layer contains information in the form of bits and transmits individual bits from one node to the next. After receiving the data, this layer gets a signal received, converts it into 0s and 1s, and sends them to the Data Link layer.\nData Link Layer: The data link layer is used to transmit messages form node to node. This layer ensures that the data transfer is error-free from one node to another over the physical layer. The Data Link Layer is divided into two sub-layers: Logical Link Control (LLC) and Media Access Control (MAC).\nNetwork Layer: The network layer is responsible for transmitting data from one host to the other located in different networks. It is also used for packet routing.\nTransport Layer: The transport layer is used to make communication between the application layer and network layer. The data in the transport layer is called Segments. It ensures the End to End Delivery of the complete message and provides an acknowledgment of the successful data transmission, and re-transmits the data if an error is found.\nSession Layer: The Session layer is used for connection establishment, maintenance of sessions, and authentication. It is also responsible for ensuring security.\nPresentation Layer: The Presentation layer is responsible for extracting the data from the application layer and manipulating it as per the required format to transmit over the network. The main functions of the presentation layer are translation, encryption/ decryption, and compression. It is also called the translation layer.\nApplication Layer: The Application layer is the topmost layer of the OSI Reference Model. The network applications implement it. These applications produce the data, which has to be transferred over the network. This layer also acts as a window for the application services to access the web and display the received information to the user. That's why this layer is called the desktop layer.",
