When a user attempts to log into the database, the user\u2019s usernames and passwords are compared to the values contained in the database. The user is given database access only if the username and password match.  The data dictionary is stored in the database and can be accessed as long as the database is available. The dictionary also contains the passwords for the administrators.\nThe data dictionary would be unavailable until the database is locked. Since starting up a down database is one of the administrator\u2019s jobs, there needs to be a way for them to log in even if the database is locked. Password file helps in this situation. A password file is an operating system file that is held on a separate disc from the database. It stores the username and password for users with SYSDBA or SYSOPER privileges.

The database waits for all currently linked users to detach from it before shutting it down, and no new connections are permitted once the statement is released. The command line is as follows:\nSHUTDOWN NORMAL\nTransactional Mode:\nTransactional mode helps shut down the database while allowing it to complete the active transactions. In this process, no new connections are allowed, and this mode waits for all transactions to finish before shutting down the database. Use this command line to shut down the database:\nSHUTDOWN TRANSACTIONAL\nImmediate Mode:\nWhen you know a power outage is at the door, you can use immediate mode. All sessions will be disconnected, all running transactions will be rolled back, the database will not wait for existing database users to disconnect before proceeding, and the database will be shut down. No instance recovery is needed during this next startup.\nIssue the command SHUTDOWN with an IMMEDIATE clause to shut down a database immediately.\nSHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE\nAbort Mode:\nWhen you want to shut down the database immediately within seconds without any active transactions, you can use the abort method. Hereafter, the statement has been released, and no new connections or transactions are permitted to be initiated. The Oracle Database automatically terminates all current client SQL statements and does not wait for existing database users to disconnect. Transactions that have not been committed will not be rolled back. All linked users are automatically disconnected from the database.\nUse the command SHUTDOWN with the ABORT clause:\nSHUTDOWN ABORT\n\nIntermediate Oracle DBA Interview Questions for Experienced Professionals",

        "question": "45. Differentiate between a cluster and a grid.",
        "answer": "Clustering is one technology used to create grid infrastructure. Simple clusters have static resources for specific applications owned by specific owners.\nGrids, consisting of multiple clusters, are dynamic resource pools shareable among many applications and users. A grid does not assume that all servers are running the same set of applications. Applications can be scheduled and migrated across servers in the grid. Grids share resources with and among independent system owners.\n \n\nAt its highest level, the idea of grid computing is computing as a utility. In other words, we need not care where our data resides or which computer processes our request. We should be able to request information or computation and have it delivered as per our requirements. This is analogous to the way electric utilities work; without knowing where the generator is or how the electric grid is wired, we ask for electricity, and we get it. The goal is to make computing a utility, a commodity, and ubiquitous. Hence, it is called a grid. This perspective of utility computing is, of course, a \u2018client-side\u2019 view.\nFrom the \u2018server-side\u2019 (or behind the scenes), the grid is about resource allocation, information sharing, and high availability. Resource allocation ensures that all those who request resources get what they need and that those resources are not standing idle while requests go unserviced. Information sharing makes sure that the information that users and applications need is available as and when it is requested for. High-availability features guarantee that all the data and computations are always available as a utility.",

The grid computing infrastructure continually analyzes the demand for resources and adjusts the supply accordingly.\n\nFor example, we can run different applications on a grid of several linked database servers. When reports are due at the end of the month, a database administrator can automatically provision more servers for that application to handle the increased demand.\nGrid computing uses sophisticated workload management that makes it possible for applications to share resources across many servers.

The next increment is used to show how much the sequence will increment at each move.\nThen using START WITH, we start the sequence either in ascending or descending.\nMAXVALUE and NOMAXVALUE are maximum limits. With MAXVALUE, we can provide the maximum sequence value, whereas NOMAXVALUE is fixed: 10^27 for an ascending sequence or -1 for a descending sequence.\nMINVALUE is used to specify the minimum value of the sequence. NOMINVALUE is fixed. For an ascending sequence, it indicates a minimum value of 1, and for a descending sequence, it indicates -10^26.\nTo allow the sequence to generate values after it reaches the limit, use CYCLE, which is the minimum value for a descending sequence and MAXVALUE for an ascending sequence. NOCYCLE is the default behavior, and it is used to stop generating the next value when the sequence reaches the limit.\nORDER ensures that Oracle generates sequence numbers in the order they are requested. If you don\u2019t want Oracle to generate sequence numbers in the order of your requests, use NOORDER. This is a default setting.",

        "question": "53. Explain how the database writer process (DBWn) works.",
        "answer": "Multiple database context processes are possible. In the operating system, they are referred to as DBWn. This method is in charge of storing \u201cdirty\u201d buffers on the disc. When a server process has to update a data block, it first reads it from the disc into the buffer cache. If it isn\u2019t already there, it updates the cache copy. So, a \u201cdirty\u201d block refers to a modified database block in the buffer cache.",

        "question": "54. What are the instance parameters that are used for configuring the shared server architecture?",
        "answer": "DISPATCHERS: In the shared server architecture, configures dispatcher processes.\nMAX _DISPATCHERS: The maximum number of dispatcher processes that can run at the same time is defined.\nSHARED_SERVERS: There will be a minimum of shared server processes on the server. This number of shared servers is determined during the initialization process.\nMAX_SHARED_SERVERS: The maximum number of shared server processes that can run at the same time is determined by this parameter.\nSHARED_SERVER SESSIONS: This is the only required parameter for using shared servers, and it defines the maximum number of concurrent sessions that can be used for shared server connections.\nCIRCUITS: The maximum number of virtual circuits that can exist in the system is determined by this parameter.",
