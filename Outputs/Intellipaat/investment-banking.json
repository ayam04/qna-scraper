        "question": "2. What are the three financial statements?",
        "answer": "Income Statement \u2013 The income statement is a financial statement that shows the company\u2019s profitability. It starts with the revenue line and works its way down to net income after deducting various expenses. The income statement is for a specific time period, such as a quarter or year.\nBalance Sheet \u2013 The balance sheet does not cover the full period, but rather provides a snapshot of the company at a given point in time, such as the end of the quarter or year. The number of assets and liabilities must always match the sum of equity and liabilities.\nCash Flow Statement \u2013 The statement of cash flows is a magnified version of the cash account on the balance sheet that accounts for the entire period, reconciling the cash balance at the beginning and end of the period.\nIt is usually calculated by taking net income and adjusting it for different non-expenses and non-cash revenue to get at cash from operations. The cash from investment and financing is then added to the cash flow from operations to calculate the net cash change for the year.\nBecome an investment banker with IIM Ranchi\u2019s comprehensive Investment Banking Course!",

        "question": "3. How can a company be valued?",
        "answer": "There are two different ways of valuing a company, namely the Intrinsic Value (discounted cash flow valuation) and the Relative Valuation method.\nIntrinsic Value (DCF): Without making comparisons to any other firms, intrinsic valuations look at a company\u2019s value based on its estimated cash flows.\nThis method of valuation, despite being essentially subjective, helps investors in estimating how much money they might make from an investment after adjusting for the value of money.\nRelative Valuation method: The second strategy entails identifying a comparable peer group, which consists of companies in the same industry with comparable operational, growth, risks, and return on capital characteristics.\nTrue, identical companies do not exist, of course, but you should try to discover as many comparable organizations as possible. Determine the relevant industry multiples. To arrive at a valuation, take the median of these multiples and multiply it by the target company\u2019s relevant operating statistic.",

        "question": "4. How to calculate the cost of equity?",
        "answer": "There are multiple ways to calculate the cost of equity, but the CAPM (capital asset pricing model) model is mostly used. The CAPM associates a security\u2019s predicted to return with its sensitivity to the entire market basket.\nThe formula for the cost of equity is\nCost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * Equity Risk Premium",

    },
    {
        "question": "5. What is higher - the cost of equity or the cost of debt?",
        "answer": "Because the cost of debt is tax deductible, the cost of equity is always larger than the cost of debt. Furthermore, the cost of equity is higher since, unlike lenders, equity investors do not receive predictable payments.\nBecause interest payments are regarded as expenses, debt is less expensive. In a company\u2019s capital structure, debt is also prioritized. As a result, in the event of liquidation or bankruptcy, debt holders are paid first, followed by equity investors.\nIs Strategic Management is the key to smart decisions, growth, and long-term success?

        "answer": "The beta (\u03b2) of investment security (i.e., a stock) is a measure of its volatility of returns in comparison to the market as a whole. It serves as a risk indicator and is crucial to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).\nA higher beta means greater risk and higher expected profits for the company.\nBecause 1.0 is the benchmark for beta, everything above 1.0 is more variable and carries more inherent risk.\nInvest in your future.

        "answer": "Deferred tax assets are resources that can be utilized for future tax reduction. It typically indicates that your company has overpaid taxes or paid taxes in advance, so it may anticipate recovering those funds in the future.\nThis occasionally occurs as a result of changes to tax laws that take place in the middle of the financial year.

        "question": "12. What does Negative Working Capital mean?",
        "answer": "Negative working capital occurs when a company\u2019s existing liabilities exceed its current assets. This means that liabilities paid within a year exceed monetizable working capital over the same period.\nBuyers often view a target company\u2019s negative working capital as negative because it represents the additional capital needed to operate the company after closing.\nA buyer wants a working capital ratio of 1 to 1.5, which indicates at least $1 in current assets for every $1 in current liabilities. This gives the buyer confidence that the company can make enough money in the short term to meet the seller\u2019s and payroll obligations.",

        "question": "13. What is the difference between cash-based accounting and accrual accounting?",
        "answer": "When cash is actually received or spent, cash-based accounting records revenue and expenditures accordingly. However, accrual accounting records revenue when it is reasonably certain that it will be collected (i.e., when a customer has placed an order for the goods) and records expenses when they are incurred rather than when cash is actually spent.\nDue to the widespread usage of credit cards and lines of credit for payment these days, most large organizations use accrual accounting; nevertheless, very small firms may choose to employ cash-based accounting in order to streamline their financial statements.",

        "answer": "The worth of a firm, project, or asset after the period for which future cash flows can be predicted is known as its terminal value (TV).\nAfter the projected period, terminal value assumes a company will continue to expand at a specific pace indefinitely. A significant portion of the total assessed value is frequently made up of terminal value.\nThe formula for calculating the Terminal value is:\n[FCF * (1+g)]/(d-g)\nWhere\nFCF = free cash flow for the last forecast period\ng = terminal growth rate\nd = discount rate",

        "question": "18. Two companies are identical, except one has debt and the other does not; which will have the greater WACC?",
        "answer": "The company without debt will be having a higher WACC as Debt is considered to be less costly compared to Equity:\nInterest on the debt is always tax-deductible.\nIn a company\u2019s capital structure, debt is ranked above equity, meaning that debt holders would receive payment first in the event of bankruptcy or liquidation.\nContrary to popular belief, debt interest rates are typically lower than the figures for the cost of equity (which are typically over 10%). As a result, the Cost of the Debt component of WACC will make up a smaller fraction of the overall sum than the Cost of the Equity component.\nWilling to become an Investment Banker?

        "answer": "There are five steps involved in creating an LBO model.\nThe first step involves creating assumptions on the Purchase Price, Debt/Equity Ratio, Interest Rate on Debt, and other variables. Depending on the amount of information you have, you may also make assumptions regarding the business\u2019s activities, such as Revenue Growth or Margins.\nThe second step is to construct the Sources & Uses section that outlines your funding sources.\nThis also reveals how much the investor paid for the deal and what you did with the money and how much investor equity is necessary.\nIn order to balance everything, step three involves updating the company\u2019s balance sheet to reflect the new debt and equity amounts as well as adding goodwill and other intangibles to the assets side.\nThe fourth step entails projecting the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement of the business in order to calculate the amount of debt that will be repaid annually based on the available cash flow and the necessary interest payments.\nThe fifth step involves making assumptions about the departure after a number of years\u2014typically, an EBITDA Exit Multiple\u2014and calculating the return based on how much equity is given to the company.",

The primary distinction between the two is that incurrence covenants forbid you from taking certain actions, whereas maintenance covenants compel you to maintain a minimum level of financial performance (for instance, the Debt/EBITDA ratio must always be below 5x).\nWhen it comes to bank debt, the principal must often be amortized over time; but, with high-yield debt, the entire principal is payable at maturity (bullet maturity).",
