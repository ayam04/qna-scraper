        "answer": "PDI supports joining of two tables form the same databse using a \u2018Table Input\u2019 method, performing the join in SQL only.\nOn the other hand, for joining two tables in different databases, users implement \u2018Database Join\u2019 step. However, in database join, each input row query executes on the target system from the main stream, resulting in lower performance as the number of queries implement on the B increases.\nTo avoid the above situation, there is yet another option to join rows form two different Table Input steps. You can use \u2018Merge Join \u2018step, using the SQL query having \u2018ORDER BY\u2019 clause. Remember, the rows must be perfectly sorted before implementing merge join.",
