On the other hand, a persistent object is linked to an active database session. Finally, a detached object is a persistent object that has been disconnected from its session.\nWhen an object is initially created, it falls into the transient category. To make it persistent, you need to add it to a session using either the save() or persist() method. Once an object becomes persistent, any modifications made to it will be automatically synchronized with the database.\nIf you find yourself needing to eliminate an object from the database, the delete() method comes in handy. It performs two tasks: detaching the object from the session and removing it from the database.\nGet 100% Hike!\nMaster Most in Demand Skills Now!\nBy providing your contact details, you agree to our Terms of Use & Privacy Policy",

        "question": "14. How does Hibernate handle database transactions?",
        "answer": "Hibernate provides robust support for managing database transactions. It follows the widely accepted approach of using a Unit of Work pattern to track and control the changes made to persistent objects within a transaction.\nWhen working with Hibernate, you typically interact with the database through a Session object. A Session represents a single database connection and acts as a gateway for all database operations. It serves as a context for managing and coordinating transactions.\nHibernate employs a transactional write-behind mechanism, meaning that changes made to persistent objects within a transactional context are not immediately propagated to the database. Instead, Hibernate tracks these changes and applies them in a controlled manner when the transaction is committed.\nThe transaction management in Hibernate can be achieved using two main approaches:\nProgrammatic Transaction Management: In this approach, you explicitly manage transactions in your code using the Hibernate API. You start a transaction by invoking the beginTransaction() method on the Session object. Once the transaction is active, you perform your database operations (such as saving, updating, or deleting objects). Finally, you commit the transaction using the commit() method, or you can roll it back if an error occurs.\nSession session = sessionFactory.openSession();\n\nTransaction transaction = session.beginTransaction();\ntry {\n\n    // Perform database operations within the transaction\n\n     session.saveOrUpdate(entity1);\n    session.delete(entity2);\n\n    // Commit the transaction\n    transaction.commit();\n} catch (Exception e) {\n   // Handle exceptions and roll back the transaction if needed\n    transaction.rollback();\n} finally {\n    session.close();\n}\nDeclarative Transaction Management: This approach involves leveraging external transaction management frameworks such as Java Transaction API (JTA) or Spring Framework\u2019s declarative transaction management. These frameworks handle the transaction management aspects, allowing you to focus on the business logic. They typically provide annotations or configuration to specify transaction boundaries, and Hibernate seamlessly integrates with them",

        "answer": "Hibernate employs caching as a means to enhance application performance by minimizing the necessity of frequent database data retrieval. Within Hibernate, there are three levels of caching supported:\nFirst-level cache (Session cache): It is the default cache and operates at the session level. It stores persistent objects within the session, allowing fast retrieval and reducing database round-trips for subsequent accesses within the same session.\nSecond-level cache (SessionFactory cache): It is a shared cache that spans multiple sessions. It stores data that is frequently accessed across sessions, such as entity objects or query results. It helps minimize database hits and benefits applications with high read-intensive workloads.\nQuery cache: It caches the results of queries executed through Hibernate\u2019s query APIs.

Second, exclude setter methods for these fields. Third, employ the \u201cmutable=\u201dfalse\u201d\u201d attribute in the Hibernate mapping file to specify immutability. Finally, implement equals() and hashCode() methods based on immutable fields. By adhering to these principles, the class becomes immutable, guaranteeing data integrity and consistent behavior during Hibernate operations, making it suitable for scenarios where data should not be altered once persisted.\n\nInterview Questions for 5 Years Experience",

It is an optimization strategy aimed at reducing unnecessary database queries and improving performance.\nWhen an entity is marked for lazy loading, Hibernate fetches only the basic attributes of the entity from the database when it is initially loaded. The associated entities or collections, known as lazy associations, are not loaded at that time. Instead, placeholder objects, or proxies, are created for these associations.\nWhen the application code attempts to access a lazy association, Hibernate intercepts the access and triggers a database query to fetch the associated data.

        "question": "31. How does Hibernate handle database schema generation and evolution?",
        "answer": "Here are the two commonly used approaches: Hibernate\u2019s Automatic Schema Generation and Database Schema Migration.\nAutomatic Schema Generation: Hibernate provides a feature called \u201cAutomatic Schema Generation,\u201d which allows you to automatically generate the database schema based on your entity mappings. This feature is particularly useful during the development and testing phases.\nBy configuring Hibernate with appropriate properties, it can automatically generate the necessary tables, columns, constraints, and indexes in the database based on your entity definitions. This eliminates the need to write and maintain SQL scripts for creating the schema.\nAutomatic Schema Generation offers different modes, such as create, create-drop, update, and validate, each serving a specific purpose.Automatic Schema Generation is suitable for scenarios where you want Hibernate to manage the entire database schema automatically based on your entity definitions. However, it\u2019s worth noting that this approach may not be ideal for production environments where more controlled schema management is desired.\nDatabase Schema Migration: Hibernate integrates well with third-party database migration tools, such as Flyway or Liquibase, which provide a more controlled approach to schema management. These tools allow for incremental and version-controlled database schema changes. With database schema migration, you create separate SQL or script files that define each version of the database schema. These files contain instructions for modifying the schema, such as creating or altering tables, columns, or constraints.\nHibernate can be configured to work alongside these migration tools. When your application starts up, Hibernate validates the current database schema against the expected version specified in the migration scripts. If there are any differences, it applies the necessary migrations to bring the schema up to date.\nThis approach provides greater flexibility and control over the database schema evolution process. It allows for collaborative schema management across multiple developers or teams and supports handling complex migration scenarios, such as data transformations or complex schema changes.",

This proxy object acts as a placeholder for the actual associated entity or collection. When a method or attribute of the lazy association is accessed, the proxy object triggers a database query to load the associated data.\nBytecode Enhancement: Hibernate also offers bytecode enhancement as an alternative to proxy-based lazy loading. By enhancing the bytecode of entity classes, Hibernate is able to insert bytecode instructions that enable lazy loading without the need for proxy objects. This approach provides more efficient lazy loading and avoids potential issues related to proxy object serialization.\nFetching Strategies: Hibernate provides various fetching strategies to control the loading behavior of associations. These strategies determine when and how the associated entities or collections are loaded. For example, you can choose to load associations eagerly (at the time of the initial query) or lazily (on demand). The fetching strategy can be configured at the entity or association level using annotations or XML mappings.",
