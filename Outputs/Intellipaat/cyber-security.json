        "answer": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack, also known as session riding or one-click attack, is a malicious exploit that tricks a victim into performing unintended actions on a website on which they are authenticated. It occurs when an attacker exploits the trust between a user\u2019s browser and a targeted website. The attack takes advantage of the fact that websites often rely on cookies or other authentication credentials to verify a user\u2019s identity.\nIn order to execute a CSRF attack, an attacker typically follows these steps:\nIdentify the Target: The attacker selects a target website or web application that has a vulnerability that can be exploited through CSRF.\nCraft the Malicious Payload: The attacker creates a malicious payload, typically in the form of HTML or JavaScript code, which will be executed by the victim\u2019s browser.\nCreate a Malicious Website: The attacker sets up a malicious website or incorporates the malicious payload into a legitimate website that they control. This website will be used to trick the victim into unknowingly performing actions on the target website.\nExploit the Trust Relationship: The attacker entices the victim to visit the malicious website. This can be done through social engineering techniques such as sending phishing emails, distributing malicious advertisements, or leveraging cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\nVictim Interaction: When the victim visits the malicious website, the malicious payload is executed in their browser without their knowledge. The payload contains requests designed to mimic legitimate actions on the target website.\nSending Forged Requests: The victim\u2019s browser automatically sends HTTP requests to the target website, carrying out actions on behalf of the victim. These requests can include changing account settings, making purchases, or performing any action that the victim\u2019s account is authorized to do.\nExploiting Authentication: The target website receives the forged requests and processes them, assuming they are legitimate due to the victim\u2019s authenticated session (e.g., session cookies) with the website. As a result, the actions requested by the attacker are performed on the victim\u2019s behalf.\nAttack Success: If the CSRF attack is successful, the attacker achieves their desired outcome, which can range from unauthorized actions to data theft, depending on the vulnerability and the attacker\u2019s intentions.",

        "answer": "When two users have the same password, it will result in the creation of the same password hashes. In such a case, an attacker can easily crack the password by performing a dictionary or brute-force attack. To avoid this, a salted hash is implemented.\nA salted hash is used to randomize hashes by prepending or appending a random string (salt) to the password before hashing. This results in the creation of two completely different hashes, which can be employed to protect the users\u2019 passwords in the database against the attacker.",

It is a network architecture that acts as a buffer zone between an organization\u2019s internal network and an external or untrusted network, typically the internet. The purpose of a DMZ is to provide an additional layer of security by segregating and isolating certain systems or services that need to be accessible from the internet.\nThe DMZ is designed to host publicly accessible services such as web servers, email servers, or FTP servers that need to be accessed by users outside the organization. Placing these services in the DMZ separates them from the internal network, reducing the potential attack surface and minimizing the risk to sensitive resources and data. A DMZ is implemented using firewalls and network segmentation techniques. \nTypically, two firewalls are employed: one facing the internet and another separating the DMZ from the internal network. The external-facing firewall allows limited and controlled inbound traffic to reach the DMZ, while the internal-facing firewall enforces strict rules to prevent unauthorized access from the DMZ to the internal network.",

        "question": "62. Differentiate between DDoS and DoS attack.",
        "answer": "Parameters DDoS Attack  DoS Attack\nAttack Method DDoS attacks involve multiple sources, often compromised computers or devices forming a botnet. These sources collectively bombard the target with a massive volume of traffic or requests, making it difficult to mitigate the attack. A single source or a small group of sources flood the target system or network with a high volume of traffic or requests, overwhelming its resources and causing service disruption or denial.\nSource of Attack DDoS attacks utilize a distributed network of compromised devices, making it harder to identify and mitigate the attack. The sources are often geographically dispersed. A DoS attack typically originates from a single source or a limited number of sources under the attacker\u2019s control.\nScale and Impact DDoS attacks can generate an enormous volume of traffic, overwhelming even robust systems or networks. They have a larger scale and can lead to significant downtime, rendering services completely inaccessible. Due to the limited resources of a single source or a few sources, a DoS attack generally has a smaller scale and impact. It may cause a temporary disruption or slowdown of services.\nComplexity and Coordination DDoS attacks demand more resources, planning, and coordination to compromise multiple devices and coordinate the attack. They involve exploiting vulnerabilities and establishing control over a network of compromised machines. Implementing a DoS attack requires less coordination and resources. It can be launched by an individual or a small group using readily available tools or scripts.\nDetection and Mitigation DDoS attacks are more challenging to detect and mitigate due to the distributed nature of the attack traffic. Advanced DDoS mitigation solutions are required, involving traffic analysis, rate limiting, or employing cloud-based DDoS protection services. Detecting and mitigating DoS attacks is relatively straightforward since the attack traffic often originates from a single or a few sources. Filtering or blocking the source IP addresses can help mitigate the attack.\nMotivation DDoS attacks can have similar motivations as DoS attacks, but they are more frequently associated with organized crime, hacktivism, or state-sponsored actors attempting to cause widespread disruption or target specific organizations or infrastructure. DoS attacks are often carried out by individuals or groups seeking to disrupt services, gain a competitive advantage, or settle personal grudges.",
