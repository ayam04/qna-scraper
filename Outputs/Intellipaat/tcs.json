        "question": "1. What is the difference between procedural and object-oriented programming?",
        "answer": "Procedural Programming Object-Oriented Programming\nFocuses on procedures or functions. Revolves around objects that encapsulate data and behavior.\nPrograms are structured using functions or subroutines. Programs are structured using classes and objects.\nData and functions are separate entities. Data and functions are encapsulated within objects.\nEmphasizes on a top-down approach. Emphasizes on a bottom-up approach.\nLess focus on reusability and modularity. Promotes reusability, modularity, and easier maintenance.\nFunctions can have access to global data. Objects encapsulate data, providing better data security and access control.\nExamples include C, Pascal, and Fortran. Examples include Java, C++, and Python.",

        "question": "2. What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?",
        "answer": "Abstract Class Interface\nAbstract class serves as a base class for other classes to inherit from. It defines a contract of method signatures that any class can implement.\nAbstract classes can encompass both abstract and non-abstract methods. It can only contain method signatures without any method implementations.\nIt can include member variables, constructors, and concrete methods. It cannot include member variables or constructors but can include constant values (static final variables).\nIt can provide default method implementations. It does not provide any default method implementations.\nIt allows for code reuse and can define common behavior for derived classes. It enables multiple classes to adhere to a common contract or behavior without specifying implementation details.\nIt supports single inheritance, meaning a class can inherit from only one abstract class. It supports multiple inheritance, meaning a class can implement multiple interfaces.\nIt is used when a base class needs to provide a common implementation for derived classes. It is used when unrelated classes must adhere to a common contract or behavior.",
