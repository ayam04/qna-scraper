We place the code that may throw an exception inside the try block, and catch the exception in the catch block.\ntry {\n\n// Code that may throw an exception\n\n} catch (Exception $e) {\n\n// Exception handling code\n\n}\nUsing Exception Handlers:\nLaravel provides an exception-handling mechanism through the AppExceptionsHandler.php file. The Handler class contains methods for handling and reporting exceptions.\nWe can customize the render() method to define how exceptions should be converted into an HTTP response.\npublic function render($request, Throwable $exception)\n{\n    if ($exception instanceof CustomException) {\n        // Custom logic for handling CustomException\n        return response()->json(['error' => 'Custom exception occurred'], 500);\n    }\n\n    return parent::render($request, $exception);\n}\nUsing Exception Responses:\nLaravel allows us to define custom exception responses that will be returned when an exception occurs. This can be useful for providing a consistent and informative error response to API clients.\nWe can create a custom exception class that extends Laravel\u2019s Exception class and define the desired response in the render() method.\nnamespace AppExceptions;\n\nuse Exception;\n\nuse IlluminateHttpJsonResponse;\n\nclass CustomException extends Exception\n\n{\n\npublic function render($request): JsonResponse\n\n{\n\nreturn response()->json(['error' => 'Custom exception occurred'], 500);\n\n}\n\n}\nThen, we can throw this custom exception in our code when necessary, and Laravel will automatically handle it and return the defined response.\nthrow new CustomException();",

        "question": "48. Explain the concept of method injection versus constructor injection in Laravel.",
        "answer": "In Laravel, method injection and constructor injection are two ways to resolve dependencies and perform dependency injection. Method injection involves type-hinting the dependencies directly in the method signature, and Laravel\u2019s container automatically resolves and injects the dependencies when invoking the method.\nConstructor injection, on the other hand, involves injecting dependencies via the constructor of a class, ensuring that the class has all the required dependencies available when instantiated.",

        "question": "49. Explain the concept of method visibility (public, private, protected) in Laravel.",
        "answer": "In Laravel, as in many other object-oriented programming languages, methods can have different visibility levels: public, private, and protected. Public methods can be accessed from anywhere within the class, from other classes, or outside the class. Private methods, on the other hand, can only be accessed within the class that defines them. Protected methods are similar to private methods but can also be accessed by child classes that inherit from the parent class.",
