While it may be interesting to experience life in a different era, the future holds more promise for continued innovation to solve significant challenges we still face today, like sustainable energy solutions, cures for diseases, and more breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and automation.\nFurthermore, the future is more diverse, open-minded, and full of potential yet unknown experiences I could never foresee today. My curiosity about what the next 100 years may bring and the knowledge and global connectivity that will emerge make the future a more compelling place to explore in theory.
