Here\u2019s a Verilog code for a D Flip-Flop with synchronous reset:\nmodule dff_sync_reset(\n    input wire clk, reset,\n    input wire d,\n    output reg q\n);\n    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)\n        if (reset)\n            q <= 1'b0; // Resetting to '0'\n        else\n            q <= d;\nendmodule\nAsynchronous Reset:\nNow, picture instantly resetting your watch, no matter what time it is. That's like an asynchronous reset. It clears the flip-flop's memory immediately, not waiting for anything else.\nHere's a Verilog code for a D Flip-Flop with asynchronous reset:\nmodule dff_async_reset(\n    input wire clk, reset,\n    input wire d,\n    output reg q\n);\n    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)\n        if (reset)\n            q <= 1'b0; // Resetting to '0'\n        else\n            q <= d;\nendmodule\nIn both cases, these bits of Verilog code describe how a memory unit works, with one type resetting at specific clock times (synchronous) and the other resetting instantly (asynchronous).",

        "question": "48. Explain Regular Delay Control and Intra-Assignment Delay Control.",
        "answer": "Here is a brief explanation of the following terms: \nRegular Delay Control: It\u2019s like setting a timer before doing something in Verilog. For instance, #10 means waiting for 10 counts before moving on to the next task.\nIntra-Assignment Delay Control: This is about adding delays to specific actions in Verilog. For example, it\u2019s like saying, \u201cWait 5 counts before changing this thing.\u201d",
