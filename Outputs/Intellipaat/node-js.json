Since Node.js supports non-blocking sending, this is a very important feature to have.\nThe working of an event loop begins with the occurrence of a callback wherever an event begins. This is usually run by a specific listener. Node.js will keep executing the code after the functions have been called, without expecting the output prior to the beginning.\nOnce all of the code is executed, outputs are obtained, and the callback function is executed.
