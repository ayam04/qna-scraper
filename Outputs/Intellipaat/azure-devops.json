        "question": "2. Why do we use DevOps?",
        "answer": "Traditional software development always had a slow code deployment time after the completion of development. The development team and operations or deployment team would get into arguments regarding its status, blaming the server or the code for the issues. DevOps acts as a solution in this situation.\nDevOps facilitates the delivery of smaller features to clients quickly and efficiently and allows seamless software delivery.",
