        "answer": "Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a software technology that makes it simple to create, deploy, and manage manual work using software robots that mimic human behavior while dealing with digital systems and software. It enables organizations to automate tasks across applications and systems in the same way that a human would. The goal of RPA is to move process execution away from people and toward bots.\nBe UiPath Certification ready. Enroll in RPA Training in Perth offered by Intellipaat.",

These diagrams are merely a structural depiction of specific tasks that must be completed. With the help of various diagrams, we may arrange any automation process visually. Each diagram depicts a specific type of task to be completed.\nUiPath Robot: After designing the procedure, the next step is to put it into action in the UiPath studio. UiPath Robots are used to turn the processes into tasks, which are then executed. These robots are used to assign various tasks and carry them out in the same manner as humans but without the need for human intervention. When a delegated job is assigned to an UiPath robot, it is meant to begin executing it automatically.\nUiPath Orchestrator: It is a web-based application in UiPath.
