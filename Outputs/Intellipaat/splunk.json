The transaction command is most useful in the following two specific cases:\nWhen the unique ID (from one or more fields) alone is not sufficient to discriminate between two transactions. This is the case when the identifier is reused, for example, in web sessions identified by a cookie or client IP. In this case, the time span or pauses are also used to segment the data into transactions.\nWhen an identifier is reused, say, in DHCP logs, a particular message identifies the beginning or end of a transaction.\nWhen it is desirable to see the raw text of events combined rather than an analysis of the constituent fields of the events.\nIn other cases, it\u2019s usually better to use stats.\nAs the performance of the stats command is higher, it can be used, especially in a distributed search environment.\nIf there is a unique ID, the stats command can be used\nAre you looking to become a Splunk SIEM expert?

There are many warm buckets.\nCold: A cold bucket has data that is rolled out from a warm bucket. There are many cold buckets.\nFrozen: A frozen bucket is comprised of data rolled out from a cold bucket. The indexer deletes frozen data by default, but we can archive it. Archived data can later be thawed (data in a frozen bucket is not searchable).\nBy default, the buckets are located in the following location:\n$SPLUNK_HOME/var/lib/splunk/defaultdb/db\nWe should see the hot-db there and any warm buckets we have.

For example, if the sales of a product drop below a threshold value, then as an administrator you can set the chart to display the values in red color.\nThe administrator can also change chart colors in the Splunk Web UI by editing the panels from the panel settings mentioned above the dashboard. Moreover, you can write the codes and use hexadecimal values to choose a color from the palette.",

        "question": "51. How the Data Ages in Splunk?",
        "answer": "The data that is entering an indexer gets sorted into directories, which are also known as buckets. Over a period of time, these buckets roll over different stages, from hot to warm, cold to frozen, and finally thawed. The indexer goes through a pipeline where event processing takes place. It occurs in two stages: parsing breaks them into individual events, while indexing takes these events into the pipeline for processing.\n\nThis is what happens to the data at each stage of the indexing pipeline:\nAs soon as the data center the pipeline, it goes to the hot bucket. There can be multiple hot buckets at any point in time, which you can both search and write to.\nIf any problem like the Splunk getting restarted or the hot bucket has reached a certain threshold value/size, then a new bucket will be created in its place and the existing ones roll to become a warm bucket. These warm buckets are searchable, but you cannot write anything in them.\nFurther, if the indexer reaches its maximum capacity, the warm bucket will be rolled to become a cold one. Splunk will automatically execute the process by selecting the oldest warm bucket from the pipeline. However, it doesn\u2019t rename the bucket. All the above buckets will be stored in the default location \u2018$SPLUNK_HOME/var/lib/splunk/defaultdb/db/*\u2019.\nAfter a certain period of time, the cold bucket rolls to become the frozen bucket. These buckets don\u2019t have the same location as the previous buckets and are non-searchable. These buckets can either be archived or deleted based on the priorities.\nYou can\u2019t do anything if the bucket is deleted, but you can retrieve the frozen bucket if it\u2019s being archived. The process of retrieving an archived bucket is known as thawing. Once a bucket is thawed it becomes searchable and stores into a new location\n\u2018$SPLUNK_HOME/var/lib/splunk/defaultdb/thaweddb/\u2019",

        "question": "52. What are pivots and data models in Splunk?",
        "answer": "Data models in Splunk are used when you have to process huge amounts of unstructured data and create a hierarchical model without executing complex search queries on the data. Data models are widely used for creating sales reports, adding access levels, and creating a structure of authentication for various applications.\nPivots, on the other hand, give you the flexibility to create multiple views and see the results as per the requirements. With pivots, even the managers of stakeholders from non-technical backgrounds can create views and get more details about their departments.",

Workflow actions in Splunk are referred to as highly configurable, knowledge objects that enable you to interact with web resources and other fields. Splunk workflow actions can be used to create HTML links and use them to search field values, put HTTP post requests for specific URLs, and run secondary searches for selected events.",

        "answer": "Alerts are the actions generated by a saved search result after a certain period of time. Once an alert has occurred, subsequent actions like sending an email or a message will also be triggered. There are two types of alters available in Splunk, which are mentioned below:\nTypes of alters available in Splunk:\nReal-Time Alerts: We can divide the real-time alerts into two parts: pre-result and rolling-window alerts. The pre-result alert gets triggered with every search, while rolling-window alerts are triggered when a specific criterion is met by the search.\nScheduled Alerts: As the name suggests, scheduled alerts can be initialized to trigger multiple alerts based on the set criteria.",

        "answer": "Search factor: The search factor (SF) decides the number of searchable copies an indexer cluster can maintain of the data/bucket. For example, the search factor value of 3 shows that the cluster can maintain up to 3 copies of each bucket.\nReplication factor: The replication factor (RF) determines the number of users that can receive copies of your data/buckets. However, the search factor should not be greater than the replication factor.",

The default time zone will be taken from the browser settings or the machine you are using.
