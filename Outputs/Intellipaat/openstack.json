Allows using the images as templates during deployment of new instances.\nCeilometer: component providing billings services and other telemetry services to cloud users. Maintains an account of component system usage by each user.\nHeat (Orchestration Engine): Allows developers to orchestrate/illustrate and store the cloud application requirements and resources needed in a file, thereby maintaining the cloud infrastructure.",

This further includes three storages:\nObject storage: to access binary objects through the REST API.\nBlock storage: offers access-to-block storage devices by affixing volumes their current VM instances.\nShared File System storage: provides a set of services to manage multiple files together for storage and exchange with multiple users at one time.\nEphemeral Storage: Referring to a single instance. As the name suggests, these storage options are temporary and short-lived and disappear once the VM is terminated.\nInterested in a high-paying career in Cloud Computing?

        "question": "8. Define the Networking Managers in OpenStack Cloud.",
        "answer": "Flat Network Manager: This places all VMs on a single network utilizing the same subnet and bridge as created by the administrator. Thus, all VMs share the same network that can be interconnected and are known to have a Flat Network Manager.\nFlat DHCP Network Manager: Much similar to the above except that the IP addresses to VM are assigned via DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).\nVLAN: Unlike the single network concept, VLAN facilitates a more secure and separate network for VMs. It has a physical switch to offer a separate virtual network and separate IP range and bridge for each tenant. This is indeed most preferable choice for a multi-tenant/project environment.\nLooking to gain skills in Web Development? Sign up for our Web Development courses now!",

        "answer": "Token is a type of authentication similar to password-based validation. A token gets generated once the user inserts the credentials and authenticates as a Keystone user. The token can then be used to access OpenStack services without any revalidation. It is interesting to note that a token is active for a limited period and must be renewed after regular intervals.\nTo create a token, users first need to authenticate their Keystone credentials.",
