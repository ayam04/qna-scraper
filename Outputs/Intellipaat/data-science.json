We know that bias and variance are both errors that occur due to either an overly simplistic model or an overly complicated model. Therefore, when we are building a model, the goal of getting high accuracy is only going to be accomplished if we are aware of the tradeoff between bias and variance.\nBias is an error that occurs when a model is too simple to capture the patterns in a dataset. To reduce bias, we need to make our model more complex. Although making the model more complex can lead to reducing bias, if we make the model too complex, it may end up becoming too rigid, leading to high variance. So, the tradeoff between bias and variance is that if we increase the complexity, the bias reduces and the variance increases, and if we reduce complexity, the bias increases and the variance reduces. Our goal is to find a point at which our model is complex enough to give low bias but not so complex to end up having high variance.",

This score is also called inertia or the inter-cluster variance.\nThis is calculated as the sum of squares of the distances of all values in a cluster. As k starts from a low value and goes up to a high value, we start seeing a sharp decrease in the inertia value.

Now, if the value is 187 kg, then it is an extreme value, which is not useful for our model.\nIn case the outliers are not that extreme, then we can try:\nA different kind of model.

        "answer": "In a decision tree algorithm, entropy is the measure of impurity or randomness. The entropy of a given dataset tells us how pure or impure the values of the dataset are. In simple terms, it tells us about the variance in the dataset.\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nEntropy(D) = - p * log2(p) - (1 - p) * log2(1 - p)\nwhere: \nEntropy(D) represents the entropy of the dataset D\np represents the proportion of positive class instances in D\nlog2 represents the logarithm to the base 2.\nFor example, suppose we are given a box with 10 blue marbles. Then, the entropy of the box is 0 as it contains marbles of the same color, i.e., there is no impurity. If we need to draw a marble from the box, the probability of it being blue will be 1.0. However, if we replace 4 of the blue marbles with 4 red marbles in the box, then the entropy increases to 0.4 for drawing blue marbles.\nAdditionally, In a decision tree algorithm, multi-class entropy is a measure used to evaluate the impurity or disorder of a dataset with respect to the class labels when there are multiple classes involved. It is commonly used as a criterion to make decisions about splitting nodes in a decision tree.",

        "question": "79. What information is gained in a decision tree algorithm?",
        "answer": "When building a decision tree, at each step, we have to create a node that decides which feature we should use to split data, i.e., which feature would best separate our data so that we can make predictions. This decision is made using information gain, which is a measure of how much entropy is reduced when a particular feature is used to split the data. The feature that gives the highest information gain is the one that is chosen to split the data.\nLet\u2019s consider a practical example to gain a better understanding of how information gain operates within a decision tree algorithm. Imagine we have a dataset containing customer information such as age, income, and purchase history. Our objective is to predict whether a customer will make a purchase or not.\nTo determine which attribute provides the most valuable information, we calculate the information gain for each attribute. If splitting the data based on income leads to subsets with significantly reduced entropy, it indicates that income plays a crucial role in predicting purchase behavior. Consequently, income becomes a crucial factor in constructing the decision tree as it offers valuable insights.\nBy maximizing information gain, the decision tree algorithm identifies attributes that effectively reduce uncertainty and enable accurate splits. This process enhances the model\u2019s predictive accuracy, enabling informed decisions pertaining to customer purchases.\nExplore this Data Science Course in Delhi and master the decision tree algorithm.\n\nData Science Interview Questions For Experienced",

Hence, when we add new data, it fails miserably on that new data.\nTherefore, to divide this dataset, we would require the caret package. This caret package comprises the createdatapartition() function. This function will give the true or false labels.\nHere, we will use the following code:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\nlibrary(caret)\n split_tag<-createDataPartition(mtcars$mpg, p=0.65, list=F)\n mtcars&#91;split_tag,&#93;->train\n mtcars[-split_tag,]->test\n lm(mpg-data,data=train)->mod_mtcars\n predict(mod_mtcars,newdata=test)->pred_mtcars\n >head(pred_mtcars)\nExplanation:\nParameters of the createDataPartition function: First is the column which determines the split (it is the mpg column).\nSecond is the split ratio which is 0.65, i.e., 65 percent of records will have true labels and 35 percent will have false labels. We will store this in a split_tag object.\nOnce we have the split_tag object ready, from this entire mtcars dataframe, we will select all those records where the split tag value is true and store those records in the training set.\nSimilarly, from the mtcars dataframe, we will select all those record where the split_tag value is false and store those records in the test set.\nSo, the split tag will have true values in it, and when we put \u2018-\u2019 symbol in front of it, \u2018-split_tag\u2019 will contain all of the false labels. We will select all those records and store them in the test set.\nWe will go ahead and build a model on top of the training set, and for the simple linear model we will require the lm function.\n1\nlm(mpg-data,data=train)->mod_mtcars\nNow, we have built the model on top of the train set.

We will bind both of them into a single dataframe. For that, we will use the cbind function:\n1\ncbind(Actual=test$mpg, predicted=pred_mtcars)->final_data\nOur actual values are present in the mpg column from the test set, and our predicted values are stored in the pred_mtcars object which we have created in the previous question. Hence, we will create this new column and name the column actual. Similarly, we will create another column and name it predicted which will have predicted values, and then store the predicted values in the new object which is final_data. After that, we will convert a matrix into a dataframe. So, we will use the as.data.frame function and convert this object (predicted values) into a dataframe:\n1\nas.data.frame(final_data)->final_data\nWe will pass this object which is final_data and store the result in final_data again.

However, since we are building a logistic regression model on top of this dataset, the final target column is supposed to be categorical. It cannot be an integer. So, we will go ahead and convert them into a factor.\nThus, we will use the as.factor function and convert these integer values into categorical data.\nWe will pass on heart$target column over here and store the result in heart$target as follows:\n1\nas.factor(heart$target)->;heart$target\nNow, we will build a logistic regression model and see the different probability values for the person to have heart disease on the basis of different age values.\nTo build a logistic regression model, we will use the glm function:\n1\nglm(target~age, data=heart, family=\u201dbinomial\u201d)->;log_mod1\nHere, target~age indicates that the target is the dependent variable and the age is the independent variable, and we are building this model on top of the dataframe.\nfamily=\u201dbinomial\u201d means we are basically telling R that this is the logistic regression model, and we will store the result in log_mod1.\nWe will have a glance at the summary of the model that we have just built:\n1\nsummary(log_mod1)\n\nWe can see Pr value here, and there are three stars associated with this Pr value. This basically means that we can reject the null hypothesis which states that there is no relationship between the age and the target columns. But since we have three stars over here, this null hypothesis can be rejected. There is a strong relationship between the age column and the target column.\nNow, we have other parameters like null deviance and residual deviance. Lower the deviance value, the better the model.\nThis null deviance basically tells the deviance of the model, i.e., when we don\u2019t have any independent variable and we are trying to predict the value of the target column with only the intercept. When that\u2019s the case, the null deviance is 417.64.\nResidual deviance is wherein we include the independent variables and try to predict the target columns. Hence, when we include the independent variable which is age, we see that the residual deviance drops. Initially, when there are no independent variables, the null deviance was 417. After we include the age column, we see that the null deviance is reduced to 401.\nThis basically means that there is a strong relationship between the age column and the target column and that is why the deviance is reduced.\nAs we have built the model, it\u2019s time to predict some values:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\npredict(log_mod1, data.frame(age=30), type=\u201dresponse\u201d)\n predict(log_mod1, data.frame(age=50), type=\u201dresponse\u201d)\n predict(log_mod1, data.frame(age=29:77), type=\u201dresponse\u201d)\nNow, we will divide this dataset into train and test sets and build a model on top of the train set and predict the values on top of the test set:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n>library(caret)\n Split_tag<- createDataPartition(heart$target, p=0.70, list=F) heart[split_tag,]->train\n heart[-split_tag,]->test\n glm(target~age, data=train,family=\u201dbinomial\u201d)->log_mod2\n predict(log_mod2, newdata=test, type=\u201dresponse\u201d)->pred_heart\n range(pred_heart)",

It is represented by the equation K(x, y) = x \u2022 y, where x and y are feature vectors. The linear kernel calculates the dot product between the two vectors to measure their similarity or dissimilarity.\nPolynomial kernel\nA polynomial kernel is a type of kernel function used to transform input data into a higher-dimensional feature space. It is represented by the equation K(x, y) = (x \u2022 y + c)^d, where x and y are feature vectors, c is a constant, and d is the degree of the polynomial. The polynomial kernel captures nonlinear relationships between data points by raising the dot product to a specified power.\nRadial basis kernel\nIn SVM (Support Vector Machines), a radial basis kernel, also known as the Gaussian kernel, is a popular kernel function used for non-linear classification. It is represented by the equation K(x, y) = exp(-gamma * ||x \u2013 y||^2), where x and y are feature vectors, and gamma is a parameter that determines the influence of each training example. The radial basis kernel measures the similarity between data points based on their Euclidean distance in the feature space.\nSigmoid kernel\nThe sigmoid kernel is a type of non-linear kernel function commonly employed for classification tasks. It can be mathematically described by the equation K(x, y) = tanh(alpha * x * y + c), where x and y represent feature vectors, and alpha and c are parameters determining the sigmoid function\u2019s shape. By utilizing the sigmoid kernel, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can project data onto a higher-dimensional space, enabling the creation of non-linear decision boundaries for accurate classification.",

A/B testing is used when we wish to test a new feature in a product. In the A/B test, we give users two variants of the product, and we label these variants as A and B.\nThe A variant can be the product with the new feature added, and the B variant can be the product without the new feature. After users use these two products, we capture their ratings for the product.\nIf the rating of product variant A is statistically and significantly higher, then the new feature is considered an improvement and useful and is accepted. Otherwise, the new feature is removed from the product.\nCheck out this Python Course to get deeper into Python programming.",

        "answer": "Content-based filtering is considered to be better than collaborative filtering for generating recommendations. It does not mean that collaborative filtering generates bad recommendations.\nHowever, as collaborative filtering is based on the likes and dislikes of other users we cannot rely on it much. Also, users\u2019 likes and dislikes may change in the future.\nFor example, there may be a movie that a user likes right now but did not like 10 years ago. Moreover, users who are similar in some features may not have the same taste in the kind of content that the platform provides.\nIn the case of content-based filtering, we make use of users\u2019 own likes and dislikes which are much more reliable and yield more positive results. This is why platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, etc. make use of content-based filtering for generating recommendations for their users.",
