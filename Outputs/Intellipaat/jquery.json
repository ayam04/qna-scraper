        "question": "8. What is a class? What is an ID?",
        "answer": "A class is a style (i.e., a group of CSS attributes) that can be applied to one or more HTML elements. This means it can apply to instances of the same element or instances of different elements to which the same style can be attached. Classes are defined in CSS using a period followed by the class name. It is applied to an HTML element via the class attribute and the class name.The following snippet shows a class defined, and then it is applied to an HTML DIV element:\n.test {font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 20; background: black;}\ntest\nAlso, you could define a style for all elements with a defined class. This is demonstrated with the following code that selects all P elements with the column class specified.\np.column {font-color: black;}\nAn ID selector is a name assigned to a specific style. In turn, it can be associated with one HTML element with the assigned ID. Within CSS, ID selectors are defined with the # character followed by the selector name.\nThe following snippet shows the CSS example1 defined followed by the use of an HTML element\u2019s ID attribute, which pairs it with the CSS selector.\n#example1: {background: blue;}",

        "question": "9. What is grouping?",
        "answer": "When more than one selector shares the same declaration, they may be grouped together via a comma-separated list; this allows you to reduce the size of the CSS (every bit and byte is important) and makes it more readable. The following snippet applies the same background to the first three heading elements:\nh1, h2, h3 {background: red;}",

        "answer": "Semantic HTML is a coding style where the tags embody what the text is meant to convey. In semantic HTML, tags like <b></b> for bold and <i></i> for italic should not be used, the reason being that they just represent formatting and provide no indication of meaning or structure. The semantically correct thing to do is to use <strong></strong> and <em></em>. These tags will have the same bold and italic effects while demonstrating meaning and structure (emphasis in this case).",

        "answer": "The main difference between $(document).ready() and $(window).load() is the timing of when the code inside their functions runs. The $(document).ready() function runs when the HTML document is fully loaded and processed. The $(window).load() function runs later when all assets like images have been fully loaded. $(document).ready() is faster as it doesn\u2019t wait for images/assets.",

        "question": "20. Explain the concept of chaining in jQuery.",
        "answer": "Chaining in jQuery allows us to link together multiple jQuery methods or actions in a single statement. This is possible because most jQuery methods return the jQuery object itself. For example, we can select an element, add a class, and show it with:\n$(\"#id\").addClass(\"blue\").show();\nChaining helps reduce code and perform multiple operations with a single jQuery selection, making code more compact and readable.",
