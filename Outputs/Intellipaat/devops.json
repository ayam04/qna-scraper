Unlike \u2018git pull\u2019, it pulls all new commits from the desired branch and then stores them in a new branch in the local repository.\nIn order to reflect these changes in your target branch, \u2018git fetch\u2019 must be followed with a \u2018git merge\u2019. The target branch will only be updated after merging with the fetched branch (where we performed \u2018git fetch\u2019).

You can check everything by using \u2018git status\u2019.\nMark and clean up the conflict: When we open the files using the merge tool, Git marks the conflicted area like this \u2018<<<<< HEAD\u2019 and \u2018 >>>>> [other/branch/name]\u2019.\nPerform the commit again and then merge the current branch with the master branch.\nGo through this GIT Cheat Sheet and know more about GIT.",

        "answer": "The forking workflow is fundamentally different from other Git workflows. Instead of using a single server-side repository to act as the \u2018central\u2019 codebase, the forking workflow gives every developer their server-side repositories. This workflow is most often seen in public open-source projects.The main advantage is that contributions can be integrated without the need for everyone to push to a single central repository to maintain a clean project history. Developers can push to their server-side repositories, and only the one who maintains the project will push it to the official repository.As soon as developers are ready to publish their local commits, they will push their commits to their public repositories. Then, they will perform a pull request from the main repository which notifies the project manager that an update is ready to be integrated.\nInterested in learning DevOps?

        "question": "57. When do you use \u2018git rebase\u2019 instead of \u2018git merge\u2019?",
        "answer": "Both \u2018git rebases\u2019 and \u2018git merge\u2019 commands are designed to integrate changes from one branch into another branch: just that they just do it in different ways.\nWhen we perform rebase of a feature branch onto the master branch, we move the base of the feature branch to the master branch\u2019s ending point.\nBy performing a merge, we take the contents of the feature branch and integrate them with the master branch. As a result, only the master branch is changed, but the feature branch history remains the same. Merging adds a new commit to your history.\nRebasing will create inconsistent repositories. For individuals, rebasing makes a lot of sense. Now, in order to see the history completely, the same way as it has happened, we should use merge. Merge preserves history, whereas rebase rewrites it.\nGo through a few AWS DevOps Interview Questions in the blog by Intellipaat.",

Also think about auto-scaling resources up and down based on usage and demand.\nThe migration plan would cover setting up the right cloud accounts and access controls, configuring networks and firewalls, deploying servers and resources as needed while making sure they comply with all our policies. Testing things out first with non-production data. And figuring out how to best monitor, scale and optimize all these applications over time as needed.",

        "question": "102. A new feature released to production starts causing increased CPU load, latency issues and some failures. The team is asking you why. How would you approach debugging this issue? What techniques and tools would you use?",
        "answer": "Let\u2019s say our app has a new feature that started causing problems \u2013 things are running slow, some requests are failing, and our servers are working harder. The developers want to know why.\nSome ways I\u2019d start investigating as a DevOps engineer:\nLook at metrics and monitoring \u2013 Many DevOps tools can show metrics for things like CPU usage, memory, network traffic. I\u2019d check graphs around the time issues started happening. If CPU spiked, that\u2019s a clue.\nReview logs \u2013 Application and web server logs often record errors or warnings about issues. Search logs from that timeframe for any common errors or repeating patterns.\nTrace requests \u2013 Tools like distributed tracing can follow a specific request through microservices. This can help pinpoint high response times and failures to a specific service.\nCompare configurations \u2013 I\u2019d check if any infrastructure or application changes were made right before issues started \u2013 new cloud settings, firewall rules, dependency versions etc. Roll back changes to test.\nPerformance test \u2013 Simulate user traffic against different app versions to reproduce issues in a test environment. Helps narrow down root cause.\nThe goal is finding patterns and reducing variables until the specific line of code, resource limit or configuration causing problems is uncovered. Using monitoring, logs, system data and tests to incrementally eliminate possibilities.",
