        "answer": "The central processing unit (CPU), often called the brain of the computer, is made up of several key components, each playing a crucial role in processing the information:\n\nControl Unit (CU): The CU gets commands from memory, decodes them, and points at the other CPU components to achieve those commands in a way to actualize them.\nArithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): The ALU is responsible for the whole completion of the arithmetic as well as logical operations that the computer needs. It is where operators perform operations, like addition, subtraction, and comparisons.\nRegisters: These memories are high-speed storage compartments that store the data and instructions that the arithmetic and logic bytes are processing. They help you have easy access to critical matters during the execution phase.\nCache: The cache, working as a superfast memory buffer between CPU and main memory (RAM), multiplies the speed of access to data needed immediately. It stores common data, which is used by the CPU, and also the instruction; hence, the CPU can fetch greater amounts of data in less time from these memories instead of RAMs.",

It sends your data to the VPN service provider\u2018s remote server, which encrypts it and passes it through. This offers several advantages for online privacy and security: \n\nEnhanced Privacy: A VPN works by scrambling your data, which makes it unintelligible to anyone who might be spying on you when you are connected to a public Wi-Fi network. This minimizes the risk of revealing passwords, financial data, or browsing activity, which can be valuable information for criminals.\nMasked Location: A VPN hides your real IP address by substituting it with the IP address of the VPN server, hence, suggesting that you are connecting from there. It effectively hides your browsing history, making online tracking impossible, and unblocks websites or contents restricted for specific regions.\nIncreased Security: This encryption will add to the security that the VPN offers by making sure that your network traffic is shielded.

        "answer": "Dividing the Network: From a single large network, subnetting divides it into small subnetworks with their unique address range.\nEfficient use of IP Addresses: Subnetting allows efficient use of IP addresses and prevents everyone in a big network from having the same key. \nSecurity Enhancement: Subnetting separates out networks using boundaries. This action actually separates traffic, problems, and any other threats within a subnetwork\nImproved Performance: Subnetting achieves this by splitting the network into smaller segments, thus leading to uncongested online traffic.\nScalability: The subnetting enables network expansion. There is no need to start from scratch with the creation of new subnets within the nested existing infrastructure system",
