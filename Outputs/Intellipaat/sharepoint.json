        "question": "5. What is LINQ? How is it used in SharePoint?",
        "answer": "LINQ is a feature of the programming languages C# 3.0 and Visual Basic .NET. LINQ allows a user to query in an object-oriented way, supports compile-time check, gives the user IntelliSense support in Visual Studio, and defines a unified, SQL-like syntax to query any data source. However, unlike other languages and query syntaxes which vary from one type of data source to another, LINQ can be used to query, in principle, any data source. Hence, developers may find that it is the only query syntax that they ever need to know. It is commonly used to query objects, collections, XML, and SQL server data sources.\nLINQ to SharePoint is officially being supported with the 2010 release. It works similar to LINQ to SQL or LINQ to Entity.\nThe LINQ to SharePoint Provider is defined in the Microsoft.SharePoint.Linq namespace. It translates LINQ queries into Collaborative Application Markup Language (CAML) queries. The gateway class for the LINQ to SharePoint provider is Microsoft SharePoint.Linq.DataContext which represents the data of a SharePoint Foundation website.\nInterested in learning Microsoft Azure?

        "question": "7. What are the advantages of service applications over SSP?",
        "answer": "The key limitation of the SSP architecture was that it was configured by using a set of services, and all web applications associated with the SSP bore the overhead of all the services even if they weren\u2019t being used. To change the service configuration for a particular web application, a new SSP would have to be created.\nThe service application architecture, on the other hand, allows a set of services to be associated with a given web application and a different set of services to be associated with another web application. Also, the same service application can be configured differently in different web applications; therefore, websites can be configured to use only the services that are needed, rather than the entire bank of services.\nAre you interested in learning Azure from experts?
