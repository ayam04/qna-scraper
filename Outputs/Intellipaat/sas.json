With Stat/Transfer, it is very easy to convert data files from one package to another in just a matter of seconds or minutes.\nTherefore, there can be quite an advantage switching from one analysis package to another depending on the nature of our problem. For example, if we are performing analysis using mixed models, we might choose SAS, but if we are doing logistic regression we might choose Stata. Moreover, if we are doing an analysis of variance, then we might choose SPSS.\nIf we are frequently performing statistical analysis, it is strongly recommended to consider making each one of these packages part of our toolkit for data analysis.",

Major uses of SAS/ETS procedures are economic analysis, forecasting, economic and financial modeling, time series analysis, financial modelling, and manipulation of time-series data.\nThe common theme relating to many applications of the software is time-series data. SAS/ETS software is useful whenever it is necessary to analyze or predict processes that take place over time or to analyze models that involve simultaneous relationships.\nAlthough SAS/ETS software is most closely associated with business, finance, and economics, time-series data also arise in many other fields. SAS/ETS software is useful whenever time dependencies, simultaneous relationships, or dynamic processes complicate data analysis. For example, an environmental quality study might use SAS/ETS software\u2019s time-series analysis tools to analyze pollution emissions data. A pharmacokinetic study might use SAS/ETS software\u2019s features for nonlinear systems to model the dynamics of drug metabolism in different tissues.",

    {
        "question": "57. How do we create a SAS data set with Compressed Observations?",
        "answer": "To create a compressed SAS data set, we use the COMPRESS=YES option as an output DATA set option or in an OPTIONS statement. Compressing a data set reduces its size by reducing repeated consecutive characters or numbers to 2-byte or 3-byte representations.\nTo uncompress observations, we must use a DATA step to copy the data set and use the option COMPRESS=NO for the new data set.\nThe advantages of using a SAS compressed data set are that there would be reduced storage requirements for the data set and only fewer input/output operations would be necessary to read from and write to the data set during processing.\nThe disadvantages include not being able to use the SAS observation number to access an observation. The CPU time required to prepare compressed observations for input/output observations is increased because of the overhead of compressing and expanding the observations. We have to remember that if there are a few repeated characters, a data set can occupy more space in the compressed form than in the uncompressed form, due to the higher overhead per observation.
