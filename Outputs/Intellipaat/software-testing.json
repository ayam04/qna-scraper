        "question": "4. Explain bug life cycle.",
        "answer": "When a tester finds a bug, the bug is assigned NEW or OPEN with status.\nThe bug is either assigned to Development Project Managers or is given to Bug Bounty Program. They will check whether it is a valid defect. If not valid, the bug is rejected, and its new status is REJECTED.\nNow, the tester checks whether a similar defect was raised earlier. If yes, the defect is assigned a status \u2018DUPLICATE\u2019\nOnce the bug is fixed, the defect is assigned a status \u2018FIXED\u2019\nNext, the tester will re-test the code. In case, the test case passes, the defect is CLOSED\nIf the test case fails again, the bug is RE-OPENED and assigned to the developer.\nPreparing for a job interview?
