        "question": "47. What is the process for adding a system to a domain?",
        "answer": "Adding a system to a domain involves the following steps:\nVerify that the system meets the requirements for joining the domain, including a compatible operating system and network connectivity.\nAccess the system\u2019s properties or settings and navigate to the \u201cComputer Name\u201d or \u201cSystem\u201d settings.\nClick \u201cChange\u201d or \u201cNetwork ID\u201d to initiate the domain joining wizard.\nEnter the domain name and provide the necessary credentials for a user with administrative rights in the domain.\nFollow the prompts to complete the domain joining process, which may involve restarting the system.\nOnce joined, the system becomes a domain member, allowing access to domain resources and compliance with domain policies.",

        "question": "48. What is the difference between RAS and VPN Server?",
        "answer": "RAS Server VPN Server\nRAS server primarily enables remote access to a network by allowing users to dial in using a modem or ISDN connection. A VPN server creates a secure connection over a public network, such as the Internet, allowing remote users to access a private network securely.\nRAS server provides dial-up connectivity and supports protocols like PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) and SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol). VPN server establishes a secure tunnel by encrypting the data transmitted between the remote user and the private network using protocols like IPSec (Internet Protocol Security) or SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security).\nRAS server is typically used for remote access to internal network resources, such as file shares or printers. VPN server allows remote users to access the entire network as if they were physically present on the organization\u2019s premises.\nRAS servers may require additional hardware, such as a modem bank or ISDN adapter, to support dial-up connections. VPN servers can be implemented using software-based solutions or dedicated VPN appliances without requiring additional hardware in most cases.",

        "question": "49. What do you mean by Child and Tree Domain?",
        "answer": "In Active Directory, a Child domain refers to a domain created beneath a parent domain. This structure forms a hierarchical relationship where the child domain inherits properties and policies from the parent domain. On the other hand, a Tree domain represents a collection of domains interconnected in a hierarchical tree-like structure, sharing a common root domain. This tree structure enables centralized management, delegation of administrative responsibilities, and domain trust relationships within the forest.",

        "question": "50. Can you explain the process of Reimaging a Computer?",
        "answer": "Reimaging involves restoring a computer to its original state by deploying a pre-configured image. The process typically starts by creating a master image with the desired operating system, applications, and configurations. Then, using tools like Windows Deployment Services (WDS) or imaging software, the image is deployed to target computers, erasing existing data and settings.",

        "answer": "IPCONFIG is a command-line utility in Windows operating systems used to display and manage network configuration settings. When executed in the Command Prompt (cmd), it provides information about the current IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, DNS servers, and other network-related details.\nThe purpose of IPCONFIG is to aid in network troubleshooting and configuration. It allows users to quickly check and verify their network settings, diagnose connectivity issues, and make necessary adjustments.\nSyntax: ipconfig /parameter_name",

        "question": "52. Explain the NTLDR Error?",
        "answer": "The NTLDR (New Technology Loader) is a crucial component responsible for booting the Windows NT operating system. It runs from the primary hard drive or a portable device like a USB flash drive or CD-ROM. Additionally, it can load non-NT-based operating systems if the appropriate boot sector is present. The NTLDR consists of three main files: NTLDR, NTDETECT, and boot.ini. NTLDR is the main boot loader, NTDETECT detects basic hardware information, and boot.ini contains system configuration details.\nNTLDR errors can occur when the system fails to boot properly. Common causes include booting from a non-bootable device, a damaged or undetected hard drive, outdated BIOS, file deletion or damage, or corrupted files. These errors can prevent the Windows NT OS from starting up successfully.\n\"NTLDR is missing\nPress Ctrl+Alt+Del to restart.\u201d\n \n\"NTLDR is missing\nPress any key to restart.\u201d\n \n\"Boot: Couldn't find NTLDR\nPlease insert another disk.\u201d",

        "question": "53. Explain Ipcofing DNS issue and how it can be resolved?",
        "answer": "IPconfig DNS issues refer to problems related to the Domain Name System (DNS) configuration on a network. DNS is responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses, allowing devices to locate and communicate with each other over the internet.\nTo resolve DNS issues using the command prompt (cmd), one has to follow these steps:\nFlush DNS Cache: Run \u201cipconfig /flushdns\u201d to clear the DNS cache.\nRelease and Renew IP Configuration: Use \u201cipconfig /release\u201d and \u201cipconfig /renew\u201d to obtain a new IP address.\nCheck DNS Server Settings: Run \u201cipconfig /all\u201d to verify assigned DNS server addresses.\nManually Set DNS Servers: Use \u201cnetsh interface ipv4 set dns\u201d to configure DNS servers manually.\nExample:\nnetsh interface ipv4 set dns \"Ethernet\" static 8.8.8.8\nnetsh interface ipv4 add dns \"Ethernet\" 8.8.4.4 index=2",
