        "question": "1. How is the statistical significance of an insight assessed?",
        "answer": "Hypothesis testing is used to find out the statistical significance of the insight. To elaborate, the null hypothesis and the alternate hypothesis are stated, and the p-value is calculated.\nAfter calculating the p-value, the null hypothesis is assumed true, and the values are determined. To fine-tune the result, the alpha value, which denotes the significance, is tweaked. If the p-value turns out to be less than the alpha, then the null hypothesis is rejected. This ensures that the result obtained is statistically significant.",

        "answer": "TF-IDF is an acronym for Term Frequency \u2013 Inverse Document Frequency. It is used as a numerical measure to denote the importance of a word in a document. This document is usually called the collection or the corpus.\nThe TF-IDF value is directly proportional to the number of times a word is repeated in a document. TF-IDF is vital in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) as it is mostly used in the domain of text mining and information retrieval.",

        "answer": "Hash tables are the data structures that are used to denote the representation of key-value pairs in a structured way. The hashing function is used by a hash table to compute an index that contains all of the details regarding the keys that are mapped to their associated values.",

        "question": "69. What is the impact of outliers in statistics?",
        "answer": "Outliers in statistics have a very negative impact as they skew the result of any statistical query. For example, if we want to calculate the mean of a dataset that contains outliers, then the mean calculated will be different from the actual mean (i.e., the mean we will get once we remove the outliers).",

        "question": "70. When creating a statistical model, how do we detect overfitting?",
        "answer": "Overfitting can be detected by cross-validation. In cross-validation, we divide the available data into multiple parts and iterate on the entire dataset. In each iteration, one part is used for testing, and others are used for training. This way, the entire dataset will be used for training and testing purposes, and we can detect if the data is being overfitted.",
