        "question": "1. What is Database Testing?",
        "answer": "Database testing is the process of examining the data stored in a database as well as assessing the functionality and components that control the database entities, such as tables, stored procedures, views, triggers, and functions. \nDatabase testing is a crucial quality assurance process that verifies the accuracy, integrity, and performance of a database system. It involves validating data retrieval, modification, and storage operations. For example, in a relational database, foreign key implementation ensures referential integrity by linking tables through a shared key, preventing inconsistent or orphaned data entries.\nData Validity Testing: This type of testing requires familiarity with SQL queries to retrieve and validate data from the database.\nData Integrity Testing: Testers evaluate data against imposed limitations and database integrity requirements to ensure data integrity.\nDatabase Performance Testing: Testers assess the performance of triggers, indices, and processes to determine their efficiency. The system should be able to handle database transactions effectively. A solid understanding of database structures is necessary for this type of testing.\nValidation of Logic: This involves verifying the logic associated with triggers, functions, and procedures present in the database.",

This can be done for a variety of reasons, such as performance, scalability, or security.\nIn testing, database partitioning can be used for the following:\nImprove Performance: By dividing the database into smaller pieces, queries can be executed more quickly. This is because the database server does not have to scan the entire database for each query.\nImprove Scalability: By dividing the database into smaller modules, it can be scaled out to more servers. This can help handle increased traffic or workload.\nImprove Security: By dividing the database into smaller pieces, it can be easier to control access to sensitive data.",

        "question": "13 Describe the concept of database normalization and its importance in testing.",
        "answer": "Database normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It is a fundamental concept in database design and is important for both performance and testing.\nThere are three main levels of database normalization:\nFirst Normal Form (1NF): Thisis the most basic level of normalization and requires that each table in the database have a primary key. The primary key is a unique identifier for each row in the table.\nSecond Normal Form (2NF): 2NF requires that each non-primary key column in a table be dependent on the primary key. This means that each column in the table must contain data that is unique to the row.\nThird Normal Form (3NF):This level of normalization requires that each non-primary key column in a table be independent of all other non-primary key columns. This means that each column in the table must contain data that is unique to the row and is not dependent on any other column in the table.\nBoyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)is a database normalization concept that ensures the elimination of partial dependencies in relational databases. It enforces stricter criteria for table design, preventing data redundancy and anomalies. BCNF is vital for maintaining data integrity and efficient query performance in relational database systems.\n\nIntermediate Database Testing Interview Questions\nHere are some of the frequently asked database interview questions for testing",

They ensure that data entered into tables sticks to predefined rules, preventing erroneous or inconsistent information. For instance, a \u2018UNIQUE\u2019 constraint ensures that a column contains only unique values, preventing duplicate entries and maintaining the accuracy of the database. This enhances data reliability and overall database performance.\nThere are many different types of SQL constraints, including:\nNOT NULL constraints: These constraints ensure that a column cannot contain a NULL value.\nUNIQUE constraints: These constraints ensure that each row in a table has a unique value in a particular column.\nCHECK constraints: These constraints allow you to specify a condition that the data in a column must meet.\nFOREIGN KEY constraints: These constraints ensure that the value in a column refers to a valid value in another table.",
