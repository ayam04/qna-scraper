        "question": "1. Define class in CPP.",
        "answer": "A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects in object-oriented programming (OOP). It defines a new data type with its own characteristics and behaviors. It is like a user-defined data type that encapsulates data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data. The class acts as a blueprint for creating instances of objects, which are specific instances of the class. It defines what data each object will hold and what operations can be performed on those objects.",

        "answer": "It is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming. It is an instance of a class, created based on the blueprint provided by the class. In simpler terms, an object is a real-world entity that has a state (attributes/data) and behavior (methods/functions).\nThe state is represented by the object\u2019s attributes, which are variables that hold specific values for the object. The behavior is determined by the methods associated with the object, which define what operations can be performed on the object\u2019s data. Objects provide a way to model and represent real-world entities and their interactions within a program.",

        "question": "3. What qualities does OOP (object-oriented programming) possess?",
        "answer": "Object-oriented programming (OOP) possesses several qualities that make it a powerful and widely used programming paradigm:\nEncapsulation: The concept of encapsulation allows bundling data (attributes) and the functions (methods) that operate on that data within a single unit called a class. This enables data hiding, where the internal implementation details are hidden from outside access and only the necessary interface is exposed to interact with the object.\nAbstraction: Abstraction is the process of representing the essential features of an object without including unnecessary details. It allows developers to create simplified models of real-world entities by focusing only on relevant attributes and behaviors. Abstraction helps manage complexity and makes it easier to work with complex systems.\nInheritance: Inheritance allows a class (subclass/derived class) to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class (superclass/base class). This promotes code reusability and hierarchical organization of classes, as subclasses can extend and specialize the functionalities of the superclass. It allows developers to build relationships between classes based on similarities and hierarchies.\nPolymorphism: It refers to the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows multiple classes to provide a common interface through inheritance, enabling objects of different classes to be used interchangeably. Polymorphism helps in achieving flexibility and extensibility in code design.",

        "question": "4. Define abstraction.",
        "answer": "Abstraction is a key concept in object-oriented programming. It refers to the process of simplifying complex systems by representing only essential features and hiding unnecessary details. In other words, abstraction allows us to focus on the relevant aspects of an object while ignoring the implementation complexities. It enables developers to create a clear and concise model of real-world entities in their programs.\nFor example, consider a car. When designing a car class, we don\u2019t need to know the intricate details of how the engine works internally. Instead, we abstract the car as an object with attributes like color, model, and methods like start(), stop(), and accelerate(). By doing this, we hide the complexity of the engine\u2019s internal workings and focus on the car\u2019s essential characteristics and behaviors.\nAbstraction is achieved in OOP through the use of classes and interfaces. Classes define the attributes and methods of an object, while interfaces provide a blueprint for the methods that must be implemented by the classes that implement the interface. By abstracting the implementation details, OOP promotes modular design, code reusability, and easier maintenance.",

        "question": "25. What is Operator overloading?",
        "answer": "Operator overloading in C++ allows you to define new behaviors for existing operators when they are used with user-defined data types, such as classes and structures. By overloading operators, you can make objects of your classes behave like built-in data types and perform custom operations when the standard operators are used on them.\nFor example, when you add two integers using the \u201c+\u201d operator, the operation performs addition. However, by overloading the \u201c+\u201d operator for your custom class, you can define how the addition should be performed for objects of that class.\nOperator overloading is achieved by defining special member functions for the class, known as operator functions. These functions have the keyword \u201coperator\u201d followed by the operator symbol they are overloading. For binary operators (operators that take two operands), the operator function usually takes one parameter (the right-hand operand) explicitly, while the left-hand operand is implicitly the object on which the operator is called.\nHere\u2019s an example of operator overloading for a custom Complex class to perform addition and output:\n#include \nclass Complex {\nprivate:\n    double real;\n    double imag;\n\npublic:\n    Complex(double r, double i) : real(r), imag(i) {}\n\n    // Overloading the \"+\" operator for Complex objects\n    Complex operator+(const Complex&amp; other) const {\n        return Complex(real + other.real, imag + other.imag);\n    }\n\n    // Overloading the \"&amp;lt;&amp;lt;\" operator for Complex objects (output stream)\n    friend std::ostream&amp; operator&amp;lt;&amp;lt;(std::ostream&amp; os, const Complex&amp; obj) {\n        os &amp;lt;&amp;lt; obj.real &amp;lt;&amp;lt; \" + \" &amp;lt;&amp;lt; obj.imag &amp;lt;&amp;lt; \"i\";\n        return os;\n    }\n};\n\nint main() {\n    Complex c1(2.0, 3.5);\n    Complex c2(1.5, 4.2);\n\n    Complex sum = c1 + c2; // Using the overloaded \"+\" operator\n\n    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; \"c1: \" &amp;lt;&amp;lt; c1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;\n    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; \"c2: \" &amp;lt;&amp;lt; c2 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;\n    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; \"Sum: \" &amp;lt;&amp;lt; sum &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\nIn this example, we overload the \u201c+\u201d operator for the Complex class to perform the addition of two Complex objects. The operator+ function takes another Complex object as a parameter and returns a new Complex object representing the sum.\nAdditionally, we overload the \u201c<<\u201d operator to customize the output format when printing Complex objects. The overloaded \u201c<<\u201d operator function is declared as a friend function, so it can access the private members of the Complex class.\nOperator overloading allows you to make your classes more intuitive and convenient to use, as well as to provide consistency with the built-in data types and expressions.

Function prototyping is essential in C and C++ programming languages to enable the compiler to perform type-checking and generate correct function calls.\nThe function prototype typically appears at the beginning of the source code or in a header file before the main program or any code that calls the function. It consists of the function\u2019s name, return type, and a list of parameter types. The actual function definition, which contains the implementation of the function, may appear later in the code.\nThe syntax for function prototyping is as follows:\nreturn_type function_name(parameter1_type parameter1_name, parameter2_type parameter2_name, ...);",

        "question": "27. What do you mean by Call by Reference?",
        "answer": "In a Call by reference is a method of passing function arguments to a function in a programming language. When a function is called with arguments passed by reference, the memory address of the actual variable is passed to the function instead of the value itself. This means that any changes made to the parameter inside the function will directly affect the original variable in the calling code.\nIn call by reference, the function parameter is declared as a reference to the data type of the variable it will receive. In some languages, call by reference is explicitly denoted using special syntax (e.g., using an ampersand \u201c&\u201d in C++), while in other languages, it is the default behavior for all function arguments.\nLet\u2019s see an example of call by reference in C++:\n#include <iostream>\n\nvoid incrementByReference(int& num) {\n    num++; // This will directly modify the original variable in the calling code\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int num = 10;\n    std::cout << \"Before: \" << num << std::endl; // Output: \"Before: 10\"\n    incrementByReference(num);\n    std::cout << \"After: \" << num << std::endl; // Output: \"After: 11\"\n    return 0;\n}\nIn this example, the incrementByReference() function takes an integer parameter, num, by reference. When the function is called with the variable num from the main() function, any changes made to num inside the incrementByReference() function will directly affect the original variable in the main() function.\nCall by reference is particularly useful when we want to modify the original variable inside the function and reflect the changes outside the function. It also saves memory as it avoids creating a copy of the variable during the function call, which is helpful when working with large data structures. However, it requires careful usage, as changes made to the parameter inside the function can have unexpected side effects on the calling code.",

        "answer": "Yes, a copy constructor in C++ can accept an object of the same class as a parameter, instead of a reference to the object. However, it is recommended to use a reference parameter to avoid infinite recursion. \nWhen using an object parameter, the copy constructor creates a temporary copy of the passed object, leading to a recursive call of the copy constructor, resulting in stack overflow. By using a reference parameter, we ensure that the copy constructor works efficiently, avoids recursion issues, and maintains a proper and safe copy of the object without causing potential runtime errors.",

        "question": "42. What are Virtual Destructors?",
        "answer": "Virtual destructors are a feature in C++ used to ensure proper destruction of objects in a class hierarchy when dealing with polymorphic behavior. When a class is designed to be inherited from and used polymorphically (i.e., through pointers or references to a base class), it is crucial to define a virtual destructor in the base class.\nThe need for virtual destructors arises due to the way C++ handles object destruction. When an object is deleted, C++ invokes the destructor for that object to release any resources held by the object. However, when a derived class object is deleted through a base class pointer and the destructor is not virtual, the behavior is not as expected.\nLet\u2019s consider a scenario with a base class Shape and a derived class Circle:\nclass Shape {\npublic:\n    Shape() {\n        // Constructor\n    }\n    ~Shape() {\n        // Non-virtual destructor\n    }\n};\n\nclass Circle : public Shape {\npublic:\n    Circle() {\n        // Constructor\n    }\n    ~Circle() {\n        // Destructor\n    }\n};\n\nNow, let's look at the following code:\n\nint main() {\n    Shape* shape = new Circle();\n    delete shape; // Problematic deletion\n    return 0;\n}\nIn this case, when delete shape is executed, only the destructor of the Shape class is called. This is because the pointer shape is of type Shape*, and the Shape class destructor is non-virtual. As a result, the destructor for the Circle class is not called, and any resources held by the Circle object will not be properly released, leading to potential memory leaks or other issues.\nTo fix this problem, the destructor in the base class should be declared as virtual:\nclass Shape {\npublic:\n    Shape() {\n        // Constructor\n    }\n    virtual ~Shape() {\n        // Virtual destructor\n    }\n};\nWith a virtual destructor, when the delete operator is called on a base class pointer pointing to a derived class object, the appropriate destructor for the derived class will be called first. Then, the base class destructor will be called automatically. This ensures that all destructors in the class hierarchy are executed properly, allowing for proper cleanup and preventing memory leaks.\nTo summarize, when using inheritance and polymorphism in C++, always declare the base class destructor as virtual if you intend to create objects of derived classes and delete them through a base class pointer. This will ensure that the destructors of derived classes are correctly called during object deletion and prevent potential memory-related issues.",

        "question": "43. How can I handle a constructor that fails?",
        "answer": "Handling a constructor that fails requires the use of exceptions. When a constructor encounters an error during object initialization, it should throw an exception using the throw keyword. This allows the program to transfer control to an appropriate exception handler. \nUtilize the try-catch block to catch the exception and handle the failure gracefully. Inside the catch block, implement error-handling mechanisms, such as displaying an error message, logging, or taking corrective actions. Properly handling constructor failures ensures robustness and maintains the integrity of the program, preventing unexpected crashes or undefined behavior.",

        "question": "44. What is Stack unwinding?",
        "answer": "When an exception occurs, all the local objects created during execution are destroyed in reverse order; this mechanism is called stack unwinding. During stack unwinding, destructors for all these local objects are called, and then the catch block is executed.",

    },
    {
        "question": "45. Can we explicitly call a destructor on a local variable?",
        "answer": "No, in C++, we cannot explicitly call a destructor on a local variable. The destructor is automatically invoked when the scope of the local variable ends or when the variable goes out of scope. \nAttempting to call the destructor explicitly would lead to a compilation error. C++ ensures automatic memory management by automatically invoking the destructor when objects are no longer in use, which helps prevent memory leaks and ensures proper resource deallocation. Instead, developers can focus on proper object instantiation and let C++ handle the destruction process efficiently, adhering to the language\u2019s design principles and best practices.",
