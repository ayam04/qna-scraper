        "question": "2. How can SQL Server instances be hidden?",
        "answer": "To hide a SQL Server instance, we need to make a change in SQL Server Configuration Manager. To do this, we have to follow the below steps:\nFirst, in SQL Server Configuration Manager, we have to expand \u2018SQL Server Network Configuration\u2019\nRight-click on Protocols for <server instance> and select \u2018Properties\u2019\nOnce we do that, we will find a \u2018HideInstance\u2019 box in which, on the \u2018Flags\u2019 tab, we have to select \u2018Yes\u2019\nAfter that, click on \u2018OK\u2019\nNote: While hiding a named instance, we need to provide the port number in the connection string so that even if the browser is running it is possible to connect to the hidden instance.",

        "answer": "Yes. We can add CPUs physically by adding new hardware, either logically by online hardware partitioning or virtually through a virtualization layer.

There are a few requirements to use CPU Hot Add:\n\nHardware that supports CPU hot add\n64-bit edition of Windows Server 2008 Datacenter or Windows Server 2008 Enterprise Edition for Itanium-based system OS\nSQL Server Enterprise\nOnce the CPU is added, we need to run RECONFIGURE, and then SQL Server recognizes the newly added CPU.\nLearn about SQL Server Certification and leave behind your peers!",

        "answer": "In the SHRINKFILE command, SQL Server isn\u2019t careful about where it puts the pages that are moved from the end of the file toward the beginning of the file.\nData becomes fragmented, potentially up to 100 percent, and hence it is a performance killer for the database.\nSlow operation: All pointers, being moved to/from the page/rows, have to be fixed and the SHRINKFILE operation is single-threaded, so it can be really slow (the single-threaded nature of SHRINKFILE is not going to change any time soon)\nRecommendations:\nFirst, use TRUNCATEONLY to shrink the file. It removes the inactive part of the log and then performs the shrink operation.\nRebuild/reorganize indexes once the shrink is done so that the fragmentation level is decreased.\nLearn more about SQL Server from Intellipaat\u2019s SQL Programming Tutorial for Beginners and take your career to the next level!\nGet 100% Hike!\nMaster Most in Demand Skills Now !\nBy providing your contact details, you agree to our Terms of Use & Privacy Policy",

A hotfix is a single, cumulative package that includes one or more files used to address a problem in a software product (i.e., a software bug).\nIn the Microsoft SQL SERVER context, hotfixes are small patches designed to address specific issues, most commonly to freshly-discovered security holes.

The trigger is written to instantiate a COM object and passes the newly inserted rows to it for some custom processing. What do you think of this implementation? Can this be implemented better?",
        "answer": "Instantiating COM objects is a time-consuming process and since it is done within a trigger, it impedes the data insertion process. The same is the case with sending emails from triggers.

We can do this either by using backup and restore or by detaching/attaching the database files. However, it is suggested to use the former as it is a safer approach. The steps are as follows:\nRun the Upgrade Analysis tool from Microsoft. Address any issues raised there, first\nIdentify DTS packages. These must be migrated manually unless we buy Pragmatic Works\nRebuild the DTS packages as SSIS\nScript out all SQL Agent jobs\nScript out all security\nBackup the systems and validate the backups (preferably by restoring them to another system)\nRun the security script on the new system\nRun restore on the new system\nValidate the databases by running DBCC\nManually update all statistics\nRun the SQL Agent script\nIntellipaat provides Online SQL Training for its learners.",

        "answer": "The database engine uses intent locks to protect placing a shared (S) lock or an exclusive (X) lock on a resource (lower in the lock hierarchy). Intent locks are named thus because they are acquired before a lock at the lower level and therefore signal the intent to place the locks at a lower level.\n\nIntent locks serve two purposes:\nThey prevent other transactions from modifying a higher-level resource in a way that would invalidate the lock at the lower level.\nThey improve the efficiency of the database engine in detecting lock conflicts at a higher level of granularity.",
