        "answer": "It is one of the features of AWS that helps one to automatically configure and spin new instances. One of the best things about AWS auto-scaling is that it does not require any interference at any stage. However, users can monitor everything through metrics and thresholds. To enable this task, one needs to cross a threshold, and without interference, one can see the instances scaled horizontally.\nGet 100% Hike!\nMaster Most in Demand Skills Now !\nBy providing your contact details, you agree to our Terms of Use & Privacy Policy",

        "question": "5. What type of storage is provided by Amazon?",
        "answer": "There are different types of storage options provided by Amazon that are effective in terms of durability as well as performance. While the combination of storage access works fine, independent access can also be provided as per the requirements.\nThe first storage is EBS, which is actually block-level storage. It has an encryption feature, and it is a good option to consider when independent storage is required.\nThe next storage type is the EC2 instance, which is a good fit for permanent storage needs. It is directly connected to the host PC as a storage disk. The data on this storage is valid as long as the instance is valid.\nAnother type of Amazon storage is called adding storage, which contains all information related to the boot instance. Amazon S3 is another option available for storage that can store large amounts of data; it is often known to be an inexpensive storage option.",

    {
        "question": "7. What do you think makes Lambda a timesaving approach?",
        "answer": "There can be a number of reasons for this. One of which is that Lambda stores everything in local server memory. Another reason can be that data is stored directly in the database without affecting performance. In addition to these features, Lambda also has simple testing techniques; for example, integration testing can be made powerful through multiple vendors.\nBefore moving ahead, you can check out this AWS Lambda YouTube tutorial to gain a better understanding of the topic.",

        "question": "10. What are the best practices for security in Lambda?",
        "answer": "Using AWS IAM (Identity Access and Management) is one of the most widely used security practices in Lambda. Granting specific users access to particular roles is another effective option to enhance security. In this security practice, access can be restricted to hosts that are not trusted or authorized. In addition to this, no matter how effective and stringent the security protocols are, they should always be updated on time.\n\n\n\n\nIntermediate AWS Lambda Interview Questions",

        "answer": "In Lambda, a function is run in either synchronous or asynchronous mode. If a function fails in synchronous mode, then it just gives an exception to the calling application. If a function fails in asynchronous mode, then it is retried at least three times.\nLearn more about AWS in this AWS tutorial.",

        "answer": "Yes, vertical scaling is possible in Lambda. Vertical scaling is one of the most in-demand features of AWS Lambda. This feature is generally used when a user needs to spin a larger instance. If, in case, they are already using an instance, it can be paused and detached from the server. In this process, it is important to note the ID of the new device post, which can continue the process.",

Serverless computing helps build and run applications and services without worrying about servers. With the prowess of serverless computing, applications run on servers, but the servers are managed by AWS. This gives developers a lot of flexibility and freedom to focus on app development.

        "question": "24. What are the disadvantages of using the serverless approach?",
        "answer": "Everything in AWS Lambda comes with its own merits and demerits, depending on the task performed. The upper limit is strictly on vendor control in the serverless approach; it offers more downtime. Sometimes, there is a loss of system functionality, along with the system\u2019s limits, which poses other issues; no dedicated hardware is available for the AWS serverless approach. In most cases, customer errors can also give rise to problems.",

        "answer": "There are many activities that can be performed on AWS Lambda; for example, it can be used to build mobile backends from Amazon DynamoDB to retrieve and transform data. Handlers transform and compress objects as they get uploaded to Amazon S3. This is done by using Amazon Kinesis, serverless processing of streaming data. The reporting and auditing of API calls can be made to any web service of Amazon, and many other activities can also be done with the help of AWS Lambda.",

    {
        "question": "29. How does AWS Lambda work?",
        "answer": "Many people consider AWS Lambda to be a little confusing, but it is not. It is just a simple four-step process that begins with uploading code to AWS Lambda. The next step is to set up your code to trigger from other AWS services, HTTP endpoints, or mobile apps. AWS Lambda will only run a code when it is triggered and will only use the computing resources needed to run it.",
