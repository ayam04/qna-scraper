        "question": "2. What is Blockchain Wallet and How Does It Work?",
        "answer": "A blockchain wallet is a piece of digital software that stores private and public keys, as well as tracks and records all transactions involving those keys on the blockchain. A blockchain wallet, in theory, does not store cryptocurrency; instead, all records belonging to these keys are stored on the blockchain on which the wallet is hosted.\nBlockchain wallets have public and private keys. A public key and a private key are used in a similar way in blockchain wallets. A public key is similar to an email address in that it can be shared with others. When your wallet is created, a public key is created as well, which you can share with others to obtain funds. The private key is a closely guarded secret. It\u2019s similar to your password in that it shouldn\u2019t be compromised, and you shouldn\u2019t share it.",

        "answer": "A smart contract is a computer code-based agreement between two individuals. They are stored on a public ledger and cannot be modified because they run on the blockchain. A smart contract\u2019s transactions are handled by the blockchain, which means they can be submitted automatically without the involvement of a third party.\nThe Smart contracts are secure, transparent, third-party-free, autonomous, and accurate.\nLet me use an example to demonstrate how smart contracts work. If Alex decides to sell his home to Bob. Then they would pay a slew of fees to third parties such as real estate agents, banks, attorneys, and others. However, with a smart contract, they can simply write a statement stating that if Bob pays this amount of money, he will be given ownership of the property. Hence, smart contracts can cut down the actual process and give us trustable options for transactions.\nCheck this video on Blockchain Interview Questions And Answers:",

Prior to being recorded, all transactions must be agreed upon. A transaction is encrypted and connected to the previous transaction after it has been authorized.\nBlockchain offers transparency. As one of the major problems in the new industry is transparency. An organization may use blockchain to create a completely decentralized network that eliminates the need for a centralized authority, increasing the system\u2019s transparency.\nBlockchain helps in reducing costs. Organizations will save a lot of money by using the blockchain instead of paying third-party vendors.\nBlockchain automates time-consuming processes in order to increase performance. With the aid of automation, it also eliminates human errors. As a result, blockchain increases efficiency and speed.\nThe blockchain allows for immediate traceability.
