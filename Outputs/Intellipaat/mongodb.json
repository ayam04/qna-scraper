Released under a combination of the GNU Affero General Public License and the Apache License, MongoDB is open-source.\nMongoDB was first developed by the software company 10gen (now, MongoDB Inc.) in October 2007 as a component of a planned platform as a service product. Then, the company shifted to an open-source development model in 2009, with 10gen offering commercial support and other services. Since then, MongoDB has been adopted as backend software by a number of major websites and services, including Craigslist, eBay, Foursquare, SourceForge, Viacom, and the New York Times, among others.

MongoDB is generally a good fit for 60\u201380 percent of the applications we build today.

For example, applications that require complex transactions (e.g., a double-entry bookkeeping system) and scan-oriented applications that access large subsets of the data mostly may not be a good fit for MongoDB. Also, MongoDB is not a drop-in replacement for legacy applications built around the relational data model and SQL.\nSome common use cases of MongoDB include mobile apps, product catalogs, real-time personalization, content management, and applications delivering a single view across multiple systems.\nTo get a detailed understanding of MongoDB, enroll in our MongoDB Training now!",
