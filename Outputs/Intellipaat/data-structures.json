        "answer": "Binary search is used when there is primarily a criterion of efficiency. It involves working on the already ordered data, which is sorted either in ascending or in descending order. To begin with, the middle element of the array is found out, and the search begins from there. The array is searched in two parts based on the search value being higher or lower than the middle element. It is key to know the order of the arrangement to help search the value accordingly.\nNext up on these Data Structure interview questions for freshers, you have to understand a commonly asked question.\nIf you want to learn Data Structures in C and master various aspects of C programming language, make sure to check out Data Structures Course from Intellipaat.\nGet 100% Hike!\nMaster Most in Demand Skills Now !\nBy providing your contact details, you agree to our Terms of Use & Privacy Policy",
