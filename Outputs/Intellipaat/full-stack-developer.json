        "answer": "CORS  (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) \u2013 CORS is a browser mechanism that allows web pages in one domain to have limited access to resources in other domains (cross-domain requests). This enables browser client scripts to interact with and access resources from different origins.\nAs a result, the SOP is extended and made more flexible (Same-Origin Policy). Same-origin restrictions limit a website\u2019s access to resources outside its source domain. CORS allows access to diverse online resources across several domains. CORS can be used to integrate web scripts when they request a resource with an external origin (protocol, domain, or port) from their own.\nTo enable cross-origin resource sharing In Express.Js we use CORS NPM modules. First, we have to install CORS in the system, and then we have to enable CORS for Express.Js. If CORS is not configured correctly then the website is vulnerable to CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks.\nCheck out our PHP Interview Questions to ace your next interview!",

        "answer": "The acronym RDBMS refers to Relational Database Management System. An RDBMS is a type of DBMS which is used to store data in a tabular form based on rows, it connects similar data components. An RDBMS provides features that ensure data security, correctness, integrity, and consistency. It\u2019s essentially a tool that lets users build, remove, and update relational databases. A relational database is a database system that stores and retrieves data in the form of rows and columns in a tabular format.\nDifference between RDBMS and DBMS-\nRDBMS DBMS\nRDBMS is used to store data in tabular form. The data stored is indexed and stored in rows. It is used to store data in the form of a file.\nMultiple data elements can be accessed at the same time in RDBMS. In DBMS, only individual data elements can be accessed.\nThe concept of normalization is followed in RDBMS, with a sort of relation between the data. The concept of normalization is not present in DBMS, also the relationship between the data elements is absent.\nRDBMS support distributed database which is capable of dealing with a larger amount of data. DBMS is used for smaller amounts of data, it is incapable of handling distributed system.\nMySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle are a few examples. Examples include XML and the Windows Registry.\nHere we conclude our basics. Expect these questions in your interviews.

        "answer": "Cluster Indexes \u2013 It is a type of index used in PostgreSQL that is used to arrange rows of data in a database based on their key values. There can only be one index based on clustering in a table in a PostgreSQL database. These clustered indexes may also be used to decide the order of the data, which is how data is stored in the database. Typically, the primary key in an RDBMS allows you to construct a clustered index based on that single column.\nNon-Cluster Indexes \u2013 In non-clustered indexing, the data and its associated index is kept separately the concept of pointer works here, there exists a pointer pointing towards the location of data. This type of indexing is also known as secondary indexing. There can exist multiple non-clustered indexes based on the specified table in a PostgreSQL database. Based on the comparison between cluster index and non-cluster indexing, cluster indexing is of a larger size.\nAlso, check out the blog on difference between PostgreSQL and MySQL.",

In a database we use the Truncate command is used to delete all the rows present in the table.\nThe Drop command deletes the whole structure of the table present in the database also it frees the memory allocated. The Truncate command does not delete the whole structure of the table from the database also does not free the allocated memory.\nOnce the DROP command is applied the action cannot be undone. The TRUNCATE command can be undone.\nThe execution speed of the DROP command is slower as compared to the TRUNCATE command. The execution speed of the TRUNCATE command is faster compared to the DROP command.\nThe view table does not exist in the DROP command.

        "question": "31. What is the concept of routing in Angular.Js? Explain its significance as well.",
        "answer": "Routing in Angular.Js refers to the way by which users can switch between various web pages while using a single-page web application. This technique allows the users to develop different types of URLs that can be used to navigate through different components of the web application.\nTo do this ngRoute module is used by the developers to access various components of the web page without reloading the whole application, this must be done after adding the ngRoute module to the dependencies.\nBecause of the concept of routing in Angular.Js, the developers can prepare a single-page web application that can redirect to different web pages.",

        "question": "35. How can we use clustering to enhance the performance of Node.Js?",
        "answer": "Clustering is an important concept in Node.Js, it enhances the performance of the Node.Js application, because Node.js apps operate on a single processor, they cannot make use of a multi-core machine by default. Cluster mode is used to launch numerous node.js processes, resulting in many event loop instances. When we use the cluster in a Node.Js app, many node.js processes are launched in the background, but there is also a parent process called the cluster manager that is in charge of monitoring the health of the individual instances of our application.",

        "question": "38. What are Shards in MongoDB? Comment.",
        "answer": "A shard is a type of single instance in MongoDB which is used to hold the subset of sharded data. It can be brought into action as replica sets to provide data redundancy and increase the availability of the data. In MongoDB, a complete set is a combination of multiple shards. The process of distributing this type of data over multiple host locations is known as sharding. The concept of sharding in MongoDB is achieved by splitting up data into smaller modular instances.",

        "question": "41. What is meant by a CSS Preprocessor? What are the terms Sass, Less, and Stylus mean? Why do people use them?",
        "answer": "CSS Preprocessor \u2013 A CSS Preprocessor is a tool that uses its programming language to extend the fundamental capabilities of vanilla CSS. It enables us to employ complicated logical constructs like variables, functions, mixins, code layering, and inheritance, to mention a few.\nSASS \u2013 SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is one of the CSS preprocessors which extends the functionality of CSS. It reduces the repetition of CSS statements.\nLESS \u2013 LESS (Leaner Stylesheets) is a CSS language extension that is backwards compatible. It enables us to use features such as variables, nesting, mixins, and so on in a CSS-compliant syntax. SASS has affected LESS, which has influenced SASS\u2019s newer \u201cSCSS\u201d syntax.\nStylus: Stylus offers a high level of syntactic freedom, supports native CSS, and allows the elimination of brackets, colons, and semicolons. It does not define variables with @ or $.",

        "question": "42. State the difference between Adaptive and Responsive designs.",
        "answer": "Here are the differences between Adaptive designs and Responsive design\nAdaptive Design Responsive Design\nAn adaptive design includes the production of a unique layout for each device on which the website will be browsed. A responsive design can alter its layout and look according to the screen size of the device being used to view it, which can range from a large desktop computer to a compact cellular device.\nA UX designer should produce up to six separate versions of a single website for different-sized displays when using adaptive design. While this is a lot of effort, it allows the UX designer to optimise the user experience for any device covered by these layouts. The responsive design generally requires less effort for a UX designer to produce, but they must collaborate with the developer to guarantee the site\u2019s layout is useable at all screen sizes.\nSmaller sites that are being refreshed generally benefit the most from adaptive design. Responsive design works well for larger sites that are being built from the ground up.",
