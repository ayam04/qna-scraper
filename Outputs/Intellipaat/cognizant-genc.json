        "question": "1. Ramu and Shamu started a business by investing Rs. 36,000 and RS. 63,000. Find the share of each, out of the annual profit of Rs. 5500.",
        "answer": "Rs. 2000 and Rs. 3500 respectively\nExplanation:\nStep 1: Calculate the total investment\nTotal Investment = Ramu\u2019s Investment + Shamu\u2019s Investment\nTotal Investment = Rs. 36,000 + Rs. 63,000\nTotal Investment = Rs. 99,000\nStep 2: Find the ratio of their investments\nRamu\u2019s Ratio = Ramu\u2019s Investment / Total Investment\nRamu\u2019s Ratio = Rs. 36,000 / Rs. 99,000\nRamu\u2019s Ratio = 4 / 11\nShamu\u2019s Ratio = Shamu\u2019s Investment / Total Investment\nShamu\u2019s Ratio = Rs. 63,000 / Rs. 99,000\nShamu\u2019s Ratio = 7 / 11\nStep 3: Calculate their shares of the annual profit\nRamu\u2019s Share = Ramu\u2019s Ratio * Annual Profit\nRamu\u2019s Share = 4 / 11 * Rs. 5,500\nRamu\u2019s Share = Rs. 2,000 (rounded to the nearest rupee)\nShamu\u2019s Share = Shamu\u2019s Ratio * Annual Profit\nShamu\u2019s Share = 7 / 11 * Rs. 5,500\nShamu\u2019s Share = Rs. 3,500 (rounded to the nearest rupee)\nSo, Ramu\u2019s share of the annual profit is approximately Rs. 2,000, and Shamu\u2019s share is approximately Rs. 3,500.",

        "question": "2. A train is moving at a speed of 132 kmph. If the length of the train is 110 meters, how long will it take to cross a railway platform 165 m long?",
        "answer": "7.5 s\nExplanation:\nStep 1: Convert the speed of the train from km/h to m/s.\nGiven, speed of the train = 132 kmph\nTo convert km/h to m/s, we use the conversion: 1 km/h = 1000 m / 3600 s (since 1 hour = 3600 seconds)\nSpeed of the train in m/s = 132 km/h * (1000 m / 3600 s)\nSpeed of the train in m/s = 36.67 m/s (rounded to two decimal places)\nStep 2: Calculate the total distance the train travels while crossing the platform.\nThe total distance covered by the train while crossing the platform is equal to the length of the train plus the length of the platform.\nTotal distance = Length of the train + Length of the platform\nTotal distance = 110 meters + 165 meters\nTotal distance = 275 meters\nStep 3: Calculate the time taken to cover the total distance.\nTime (t) = Distance / Speed\nTime taken to cross the platform = Total distance / Speed of the train\nTime taken to cross the platform = 275 meters / 36.67 m/s\nTime taken to cross the platform = 7.50 seconds (rounded to two decimal places)\nSo, it will take 7.50 seconds for the train to cross the railway platform.",

        "question": "3. The difference between the value of the number increased by 20 % and the value of the number decreased by 25 % is 36. What is the number?",
        "answer": "80\nExplanation:\nLet\u2019s assume the required number as \u201cx.\u201d\nStep 1: Calculate the value of the number increased by 20%\nValue after 20% increase = x + 0.20x\nValue after 20% increase = 1.20x\nStep 2: Calculate the value of the number decreased by 25%\nValue after 25% decrease = x \u2013 0.25x\nValue after 25% decrease = 0.75x\nStep 3: Set up the equation based on the given information\nThe difference between the two values is given as 36. So, we have:\n1.20x \u2013 0.75x = 36\nStep 4: Solve the equation for \u201cx\u201d\nCombine like terms:\n0.45x = 36\nNow, isolate \u201cx\u201d by dividing both sides by 0.45:\nx = 36 / 0.45\nx = 80\nStep 5: Check the solution\nLet\u2019s verify that the difference between the value increased by 20% and the value decreased by 25% is indeed 36:\nValue after 20% increase = 1.20 * 80 = 96\nValue after 25% decrease = 0.75 * 80 = 60\nDifference = 96 \u2013 60 = 36\nSince the difference matches the given information, the number is indeed 80.",

        "question": "4. 40 % is the passing marks. A student gets 250 marks yet fails by 38 marks. What are the maximum marks?",
        "answer": "720\nExplanation:\nLet\u2019s assume the maximum marks in the exam as \u201cM.\u201d\nStep 1: Calculate the passing marks (40% of the maximum marks)\nPassing Marks = 0.40 * M\nStep 2: Calculate the marks obtained by the student (250 marks)\nMarks Obtained = 250\nStep 3: Calculate the marks required to pass\nMarks Required to Pass = Passing Marks \u2013 Marks Obtained\nMarks Required to Pass = 0.40 * M \u2013 250\nStep 4: It is given that the student fails by 38 marks. So, set up the equation:\nMarks Required to Pass = 38\nStep 5: Combine the equations and solve for \u201cM\u201d\n0.40 * M \u2013 250 = 38\nStep 6: Solve for \u201cM\u201d\nAdd 250 to both sides to isolate 0.40 * M:\n0.40 * M = 38 + 250\n0.40 * M = 288\nNow, divide both sides by 0.40 to find the value of \u201cM\u201d:\nM = 288 / 0.40\nM = 720\nSo, the maximum marks in the exam are 720.",

        "question": "5. The sum of the ages of 5 children born at the intervals of 3 years each is 50 years. What is the age of the youngest child?",
        "answer": "4 years old\nExplanation:\nLet\u2019s represent the age of the youngest child as \u201cx\u201d years.\nSince there are 5 children with ages at intervals of 3 years each, we can set up the following equations:\n1st child\u2019s age = x\n2nd child\u2019s age = x + 3 (3 years older than the youngest)\n3rd child\u2019s age = x + 6 (3 years older than the second child)\n4th child\u2019s age = x + 9 (3 years older than the third child)\n5th child\u2019s age = x + 12 (3 years older than the fourth child)\nNow, the sum of their ages is given as 50 years:\nx + (x + 3) + (x + 6) + (x + 9) + (x + 12) = 50\nLet\u2019s solve for \u201cx\u201d:\n5x + 30 = 50\n5x = 20\nx = 4\nTherefore, the age of the youngest child (1st child) is 4 years old.\n\nCognizant GenC DSA-Based Questions",

        "question": "6. What is a data structure, and how many types are there? Explain",
        "answer": "A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer\u2019s memory to facilitate efficient operations and manipulations of that data. Data structures provide a means of representing and managing data in a structured and organized manner.\nThere are two types of data structures:\n1) Linear data structure\n2) Non-linear data structure\nLinear Data Structure: A data structure that includes data elements arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is connected to its previous and next nearest elements, is referred to as a linear data structure. Arrays and linked lists are two examples of linear data structures.\nNon-Linear Data Structure: Non-linear data structures are data structures in which data elements are not arranged linearly or sequentially. In a non-linear data structure, we cannot walk through all elements in one pass, as in a linear data structure. Trees and graphs are two examples of non-linear data structures.",

        "question": "7. What is a linked list? Explain its types.",
        "answer": "A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are stored as separate nodes, each containing a reference to the next node, forming a chain-like structure that allows efficient insertion and deletion operations.\nThere are three types of linked lists: singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.\nSingly Linked List: In this type of linked list, every node stores the address or reference of the next node in the list, and the last node has the next address or reference as NULL.\nDoubly Linked List: Two references are associated with each node. One of the reference points is to the next node, and one is to the previous node.\nCircular Linked List: A circular linked list is a type of linked list in which all nodes are interconnected to form a circle. There is no NULL node at the end. This type of linked list can take the form of either a singly circular linked list or a doubly circular linked list.",
