When you just need to select only one element, use the ID selector, while if you want to select a group of elements, having the same CSS class then use a class selector. There is a good chance that the interviewer will ask you to write a code using ID and class selector.

Well, apart from many advantages including reducing server bandwidth and faster download, one of the most important advantages is that if the browser has already downloaded  the same jQuery version from the same CDN, then it won\u2019t download it again.

This means it can apply to instances of the same element or instances of different elements to which the same style can be attached. Classes are defined in CSS using a period followed by the class name. It is applied to an HTML element via the class attribute and the class name.\nThe following snippet shows a class defined and its application to an HTML DIV element.\n.test {\nfont-family: Helvetica;\nfont-size: 20;\nbackground: black;\n}\ntest\nAlso, you could define a style for all elements with a defined class. This is demonstrated with the following code that selects all P elements with specified column class.\np.column {\nfont-color: black;\n}\nAn ID selector is a name assigned to a specific style. It can be associated with one HTML element with the assigned ID. Within CSS, ID selectors are defined with the # character followed by the selector name.\nThe following snippet shows the CSS example1 defined followed by the use of an HTML element\u2019s ID attribute, which pairs it with the CSS selector.\n#example1 {\nbackground: blue;\n}",

        "answer": "CSS style rules \u201ccascade\u201d in the sense that they follow an order of precedence. Global style rules apply first to HTML elements, and local style rules override them. For example, a style defined in a style element in a webpage overrides a style defined in an external style sheet. Similarly, an inline style that is defined in an HTML element in the page overrides any styles that are defined for that same element elsewhere. The !important rule is a way to make your CSS cascade but also have the rules you feel are most crucial always be applied. A rule that has the !important property will always be applied no matter where that rule appears in the CSS document. So if you wanted to make sure that a property always applied, you would add the !important property to the tag. So, to make the paragraph text always red, in the above example, you would write:p { color: #ff0000 !important; }p { color: #000000; }\nAlso, check our blog on A Guide to HTML Link (Hyperlinks)!",
