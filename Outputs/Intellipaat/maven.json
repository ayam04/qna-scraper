        "question": "1. How do you define Maven?",
        "answer": "Typically used in Java-based projects, Maven is a powerful build automation and project management tool. It offers a methodical and effective way to handle dependencies, compile code, execute tests, package applications, and distribute them. It follows the principle of convention over configuration, which implies that it imposes a typical project structure and specified build lifecycle steps, minimizing the need for manual configuration. Through the use of a central repository system, Maven also facilitates reusability by making it easier to manage project dependencies. Overall, Maven makes building software easier and aids in maintaining a stable, controllable project structure.",
