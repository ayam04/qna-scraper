The first step to improving the efficiency of your team is understanding when to make such a switch from manual to automated testing. When deciding whether to use manual or automated testing, you should consider the following factors: Manual Testing:   \nNew functionality has been added to the application.\nTesting is only needed once or twice, and frequent repetition is not required.\nAutomated Testing:\nA significant amount of regression testing is necessary before every release.\nTesting by hand is insufficient in labor-intensive situations, such as performance testing, functional testing. However, automated testing does not require much labor because it runs with the aid of tools, scripts, and software that perform predefined actions specified in test cases.

Thus, you don't need to set up anything extra to run Android tests within your development environment. It makes Android application testing faster and more reliable. Rather than using classes in Android, Robotetrics used shadow objects. If Robolectric implements a method, this method call is forwarded to the shadow object and it behaves similarly to the Android implementation.

        "question": "10. What does mobile security testing include?",
        "answer": "Having secure mobile applications is very important for the business, which in turn, requires testing for the security of all mobile applications. Security testing is therefore considered important testing by testers. Authentication, authorization, data security, hacking vulnerabilities, session management, etc., are all included in mobile application security testing. This test can ensure there aren't any loopholes allowing data to be lost. Testing is meant to identify any potential threats or vulnerabilities that could allow external parties to access private information on the mobile device.   Testing mobile applications for security include the following: Check if the application supports multiple users without interfering with their data.\nVerifies sensitive data is communicated using a decryption or encryption method.\nVerifies that anyone with unauthorized access to files stored in the app is not accessing them.\nIdentify sensitive areas of the application to ensure it does not receive any malicious content.\nValidates an application's resistance to malicious attacks or cyber-attacks and ensures that developers adhere to security practices when programming.

        "answer": "A Test Case Runner is a software tool that allows mobile applications to be tested. In essence, runners act as an environment that represents both the device and the end-users. A near-exact simulation of the user environment is generated and the application's functionalities are tested just as if a human were using the device. It helps determine whether the application is ready for launch. Commonly called an instrumentation test runner, it runs test cases on an application smoothly.",

        "question": "5. What are the performance testing scenarios?",
        "answer": "During performance testing, an application is evaluated on how well it performs and behaves under various loads. In this test, the application is continuously and steadily loaded until it reaches a threshold point (a point beyond which the application cannot withstand the load). This ensures that the application performs as expected under certain conditions like when large numbers of users access it or when a key infrastructure component such as a database server is eliminated. The most common scenarios in performance testing include: Test the application under various load conditions to determine if it performs as expected.\nCheck the current network coverage for its ability to support maximum, average, and minimum user levels.\nEnsure that client-server configurations provide optimal levels of performance.\nIdentify the application and infrastructure bottlenecks that affect the app's performance.\nAnalyze whether the hardware and/or product can cope with the projected load volumes.\nEvaluation of the battery life's ability to support the expected load volumes.\nCheck the performance of the application when it's switched from a 2G/3G network to WiFi or vice versa.\nMake sure that battery consumption, memory leakage, GPS, and camera performance are within permissible limits.\nValidate the app's endurance whenever there is a high user load. Test the application under various load conditions to determine if it performs as expected. Check the current network coverage for its ability to support maximum, average, and minimum user levels.
