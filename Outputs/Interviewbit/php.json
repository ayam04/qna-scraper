        "question": "1. What is a session in PHP?",
        "answer": "A session in PHP is a way to store information to be used across multiple pages of an entire website. The information is not stored on the user\u2019s computer, unlike cookies. In a temporary directory on the server, a file will be created by the session where registered session variables and their values are stored. This information will be available to all pages on the site during that visit. When you work with an application, you open it, do some modifications, and then you close it. This is much like a Session. The computer knows who you are. It knows when the application is started and ended by you. But on the internet, the webserver does not know who you are or what you do, because the HTTP address doesn\u2019t maintain a state. This problem is solved using session variables by storing user information to be used across multiple pages (e.g. username, favorite color, etc). By default, session variables will last until the user closes the browser. So Session variables hold single user information and are available to all pages in one application.",

It allows the attacker to exploit vulnerabilities present in the web file under attack. Let\u2019s take a simple example. Consider we have a \u201cShow File\u201d button that opens up some URL. For a classic directory traversal attack, the attacker may try to access the system file /etc/passwd (assuming a UNIX/LINUX system). If the application receives the value of the file parameter from the URL and passes it to a system call, it would traverse the relative path ../../etc/passwd starting from /var/www and ask the system to load the password file.

        "question": "6. How to create API in PHP?",
        "answer": "API stands for Application Programming Interface. It defines the functions and variables. Communication between the database via PHP extensions is handled by API. Now, REST API is the web architecture that uses HTTP protocol for exchanging data between two functions that means your application or system. Now, let us have a look at how to create REST API in PHP by considering the example of accessing data from a database using PHP script. Step 1 - Create a database: To create a database run the query given below: Step 1 - Create a database: CREATE DATABASE phptest; CREATE DATABASE phptest; Step 2 - Create a table: After creating a database, you have to create a table with dummy data. To create a table run the query given below: Step 2 - Create a table: CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `transactions` \n(\n   `id` int(20) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\n   `order_id` int(50) NOT NULL,\n   `amount` decimal(9,2) NOT NULL,\n   `response_code` int(10) NOT NULL,\n   `response_desc` varchar(50) NOT NULL,\n   PRIMARY KEY (`id`),\n   UNIQUE KEY `order_id` (`order_id`)\n) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 ; CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `transactions` \n(\n   `id` int(20) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\n   `order_id` int(50) NOT NULL,\n   `amount` decimal(9,2) NOT NULL,\n   `response_code` int(10) NOT NULL,\n   `response_desc` varchar(50) NOT NULL,\n   PRIMARY KEY (`id`),\n   UNIQUE KEY `order_id` (`order_id`)\n) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 ; IF int 20 NULL int 50 NULL 9 2 NULL int 10 NULL 50 NULL DEFAULT Step 3 - Create a Database Connection: Create a db.php file and paste the below-given database connection in it. Make sure to update these credentials with your database credentials. Step 3 - Create a Database Connection: <?php\n// Enter your Host, username, password, database below.\n$con = mysqli_connect(\"localhost\",\"root\",\"\",\"phptest\");\nif (mysqli_connect_errno())\n{\n    echo \"Failed to connect to MySQL: \" . mysqli_connect_error();\n    die();\n}\n?> <?php\n// Enter your Host, username, password, database below.\n$con = mysqli_connect(\"localhost\",\"root\",\"\",\"phptest\");\nif (mysqli_connect_errno())\n{\n    echo \"Failed to connect to MySQL: \" . mysqli_connect_error();\n    die();\n}\n?> <?php // Enter your Host, username, password, database below. $con \"localhost\" \"root\" \"\" \"phptest\" if echo \"Failed to connect to MySQL: \" die ?> Step 4 - Create a REST API File: Create an api.php file and copy the following script in it. Step 4 - Create a REST API File: <?php\nheader(\"Content-Type:application/json\");\nif (isset($_GET['order_id']) && $_GET['order_id']!=\"\") \n{\ninclude('db.php');\n$order_id = $_GET['order_id'];\n$result = mysqli_query($con,\n       \"SELECT * FROM `transactions` WHERE order_id=$order_id\");\nif(mysqli_num_rows($result)>0)\n       {\n    $row = mysqli_fetch_array($result);\n    $amount = $row['amount'];\n           $response_code = $row['response_code'];\n           $response_desc = $row['response_desc'];\n    response($order_id, $amount, $response_code, $response_desc);\n    mysqli_close($con);\n}\n       else\n       {\n     response(NULL, NULL, 200,\"No Record Found\");\n}\n}\nelse\n{\nresponse(NULL, NULL, 400,\"Request is invalid\");\n}\nfunction response($order_id,$amount,$response_code, $response_desc)\n{\n$response['order_id'] = $order_id;\n$response['amount'] = $amount;\n$response['response_code'] = $response_code;\n       $response['response_desc'] = $response_desc;\n$json_response = json_encode($response);\necho $json_response;\n}\n?> <?php\nheader(\"Content-Type:application/json\");\nif (isset($_GET['order_id']) && $_GET['order_id']!=\"\") \n{\ninclude('db.php');\n$order_id = $_GET['order_id'];\n$result = mysqli_query($con,\n       \"SELECT * FROM `transactions` WHERE order_id=$order_id\");\nif(mysqli_num_rows($result)>0)\n       {\n    $row = mysqli_fetch_array($result);\n    $amount = $row['amount'];\n           $response_code = $row['response_code'];\n           $response_desc = $row['response_desc'];\n    response($order_id, $amount, $response_code, $response_desc);\n    mysqli_close($con);\n}\n       else\n       {\n     response(NULL, NULL, 200,\"No Record Found\");\n}\n}\nelse\n{\nresponse(NULL, NULL, 400,\"Request is invalid\");\n}\nfunction response($order_id,$amount,$response_code, $response_desc)\n{\n$response['order_id'] = $order_id;\n$response['amount'] = $amount;\n$response['response_code'] = $response_code;\n       $response['response_desc'] = $response_desc;\n$json_response = json_encode($response);\necho $json_response;\n}\n?> <?php \"Content-Type:application/json\" if isset $_GET 'order_id' $_GET 'order_id' \"\" include 'db.php' $order_id $_GET 'order_id' $result $con \"SELECT * FROM `transactions` WHERE order_id=$order_id\" $order_id if $result 0 $row $result $amount $row 'amount' $response_code $row 'response_code' $response_desc $row 'response_desc' $order_id $amount $response_code $response_desc $con else NULL NULL 200 \"No Record Found\" else NULL NULL 400 \"Request is invalid\" function response($order_id,$amount,$response_code, $response_desc) function response $order_id,$amount,$response_code, $response_desc $order_id $amount $response_code $response_desc $response 'order_id' $order_id $response 'amount' $amount $response 'response_code' $response_code $response 'response_desc' $response_desc $json_response $response echo $json_response ?> The above code will accept the GET request and return output in the JSON format.

        "answer": "PDO stands for PHP Data Object. PDO is a set of PHP extensions that provide a core PDO class and database, specific drivers. The PDO extension can access any database which is written for the PDO driver. There are several PDO drivers available which are used for FreeTDS, Microsoft SQL Server, IBM DB2, Sybase, Oracle Call Interface, Firebird/Interbase 6 and PostgreSQL databases, etc. It gives a lightweight, vendor-neutral, data-access abstraction layer. Hence, no matter what database we use, the function to issue queries and fetch data will be the same. And, it focuses on data access abstraction instead of database abstraction.",

        "question": "9. Explain type hinting in PHP",
        "answer": "In PHP, type hinting is used to specify the expected data type (arrays, objects, interface, etc.) for an argument in a function declaration. It was introduced in PHP 5. Whenever the function is called, PHP checks if the arguments are of a user-preferred type or not. If the argument is not of the specified type, the run time will display an error and the program will not execute. It is helpful in better code organization and improved error messages. Example usage: Example usage: //sendEmail() function argument $email is type hinted of Email Class. It means to call this function you must have to pass an email object otherwise an error is generated.\n<?php\n    function sendEmail (Email $email)\n    {\n      $email->send();\n    }\n?> //sendEmail() function argument $email is type hinted of Email Class. It means to call this function you must have to pass an email object otherwise an error is generated.\n<?php\n    function sendEmail (Email $email)\n    {\n      $email->send();\n    }\n?> //sendEmail() function argument $email is type hinted of Email Class. It means to call this function you must have to pass an email object otherwise an error is generated. <?php function sendEmail (Email $email) function sendEmail Email $email $email $email ?>",

        "question": "10. How to terminate the execution of a script in PHP?",
        "answer": "To terminate the execution of the script in PHP, the exit() function is used. It is a built-in function that outputs a message and then terminates the current script. The message which you want to display is passed as a parameter to the exit() function. Script termination will be done by this function after displaying the message. It is an alias of die() function. It doesn\u2019t return any value. Syntax: exit(message) Where the message is a parameter to be passed as an argument. It defines a message or status. Example: The code given below will print a message and exit the current script. <?php\n$site = \"https://www.interviewbit.com//\";\nfopen($site,\"r\")\nor exit(\"Unable to connect to $site\");\n?> <?php\n$site = \"https://www.interviewbit.com//\";\nfopen($site,\"r\")\nor exit(\"Unable to connect to $site\");\n?> <?php $site \"https://www.interviewbit.com//\" $site \"r\" or exit \"Unable to connect to $site\" $site ?> Conclusion PHP proves to be a great tool for writing dynamic web pages.
