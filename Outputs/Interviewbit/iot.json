        "question": "1. What do you mean by replication?",
        "answer": "In replication, data is synchronized between two or more servers. This is a method of storing the same data on more than one site or server. This feature allows data to be accessed seamlessly even during server downtimes or heavy traffic. Users gain consistent access to data while not interfering with or slowing down those of other users.   Replication of data is more than just a backup. A publisher is considered to be the server that originates the data, and a subscriber is the one where it is replicated. Data replication involves the publisher synchronizing its transaction with the subscriber and updating subscriber data automatically. A change made on the publisher's side is automatically reflected on the subscriber's side as well.",

IoT devices connect and communicate through their technical communication models. An effective communication model shows how the process works and helps one understand how communication can be done. The Internet of Things (IoT) enables people and things (devices) to be connected wherever they are, using any network or service they like. Types of communication models - Request-Response Model: This communication model is based on the client (IoT Device) making requests and the server responding to those requests. Upon receiving a request, the server decides what response to provide, fetches the requested data, prepares the response, and then sends it back to the client. This model is stateless because the data between requests is not retained, therefore each request is handled independently.

Request-Response Model:   Publisher-Subscriber Model: Publishers, brokers, and consumers are all involved in this communication model. Publishes are the sources of data that send data to topics. The broker manages the topics, and consumers (consume data from topics) subscribe to the topics. Publishers and consumers are unaware of each other. Upon receiving data for a topic from the publisher, the broker forwards it to all subscribed consumers. As a result, brokers are responsible for receiving data from publishers and sending it to the appropriate consumers.

Publisher-Subscriber Model:   Push-Pull Model: This communication model entails data producers pushing the data into queues, while data consumers pull the data from the queues. Neither producer nor consumer needs to know about each other. The queues help decouple the messages between the consumers and the producers. Also, queues act as a buffer when there is a mismatch between the rate at which producers push data and the rate at which consumers pull it.

A sensor gathers live data from the surrounding environment and sent to a cloud infrastructure. Once the data reaches the cloud, the software can process it and decide what action to take, such as sending an alert or automatically adjusting the sensors/devices without user intervention. A user interface is used if user input is required or if they want to check in on the system. Adjustments made by the user are then sent inversely through the system - from the user interface to the cloud, and from the cloud back to the sensors/devices to make changes.
