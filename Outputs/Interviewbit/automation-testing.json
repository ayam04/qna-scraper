        "question": "1. What is automation testing?",
        "answer": "Automation testing is a software testing strategy in which a tester programmatically runs the tests using a tool or a framework instead of manually going through the test cases and executing them one by one.   The primary goal of automated testing is to save time, effort, and money on repetitive tests that don\u2019t change frequently. Automation testing helps teams and organizations automate the testing efforts, in turn reducing the need for human intervention and thus achieving greater speed, reliability, and efficiency. It also helps speed up the development cycle, as the developers get quick feedback and can iterate quickly.",

        "question": "2. What is the test automation pyramid?",
        "answer": "Martin Fowler was the original creator of the test automation pyramid, which was introduced in 2012. It is a strategy for determining how to make the most effective use of the numerous kinds of testing automation available.  The basic tenet of the test pyramid is to have a large number of user interface (UI) unit tests and a small number of complete UI tests.   The testing of user interfaces is a delicate process. The way that user interfaces are designed is undergoing fast change. An update to the software has a high potential of breaking several tests, which will require the team to update them. The testing of the user interface adds additional time to the building process. As long as you have the licence for the GUI testing tool, you can accomplish this task with as few as two or three PCs. For this reason, the test pyramid recommends adding additional automated unit tests in addition to the standard ones that focus on UI automation. Additionally, it offers a service testing layer in the middle, which removes the need to deal with UI frameworks while still providing many of the same benefits as complete end-to-end UI tests. These tests can yield many of the same advantages as full end-to-end UI tests.",

        "question": "4. What is automated regression testing?",
        "answer": "Software is never done. The developers are constantly adding new features, functions, fixing bugs, and so on. There is a chance that all this new code might break the existing functionality that was working. Users dislike using a product that is broken after they download and install a new release. They expect a consistent and reliable experience from the software, no matter which version they are using. They also expect that previously working features will keep on working and won't break in the future. Regression testing is a testing technique where a tester makes sure that the new features didn't break any existing functionality. Its goal is to ensure that previously developed and tested functionality still works after adding new code. When a tester performs the regression testing automatically using testing frameworks and tools, it's known as automated regression testing. In automated regression testing, a tester runs the suite of regression tests after each new release of the software. If the tests pass, then the tester continues with other types of testing. However, if it fails, then there is no point in further proceeding with tests until the developers fix the broken regression tests. Hence, they also act as a time-saver for the tester and ensure quality in software before shipping it.",

Some users could be using Google Chrome on their Android phones, some might use Firefox on a Windows desktop machine, or others could use Safari on their Macbooks. Cross-browser testing ensures that your web application works as expected on different versions of popular browsers on multiple platforms and devices. It ensures that the users get the same experience and features irrespective of which browser they use. It helps to reach a wide range of users, allows the users to switch browsers and devices, and still get the same user experience, increasing customer satisfaction and building a loyal user base.",

Hence, it\u2019s crucial to test the web application or the website on multiple major browsers running on different operating systems. Cross-browser testing is a type of browser automation testing where the tester verifies if the web application will work smoothly on different browsers. Some of the popular browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, etc.   The goal of the cross-browser testing is to launch the application on various browsers running on different operating systems, e.g. Windows, Mac OS, Linux, etc., and verify that the application works as expected. The tester looks for the design/rendering issues, the functionality of the application, and device-specific functionality. Though it can be typically, sophisticated tools exist that allow the testers to automate cross-browser testing. Some examples include Selenium Box, BrowserStack, Browsershots, LambdaTest, etc.",

        "question": "8. What is a test environment?",
        "answer": "A test environment is a computer or a server on which a tester tests the software. After the team builds the software, the tester installs it on this computer with all its dependencies, just like the production environment. This allows the tester to test the software in a real-world scenario.   A test environment enables the tester to create reliable test setups which are identical whenever a new version of the software is released. The test environment includes the test bed, which is the test data using which the tester will test the software. This data helps the tester to verify test cases that need a particular setup. Typically, the test environment is an identical copy of the production environment. Having a duplicate copy allows the tester to reliably reproduce the bugs reported by the customers and provide the exact steps to the developers to fix them. Here are some prerequisites for a good test environment: A server with a similar configuration, including the software and the hardware to match a production environment.\nSample test data with which to test the software.\nTest database with reasonably realistic data, it can be a copy of an actual production database.\nInstalled software under the test.

        "answer": "Although test automation has its advantages, it is not practical to automate all kinds of testing. Some testing can be done only by a human tester, such as user interface testing, usability, and accessibility testing. Exploratory testing is another type of testing where a human tester provides more value than an automated test. In exploratory testing, a tester explores the software randomly, just as an end-user would do, and tries to find the bugs or UI inconsistencies or any hidden problems that developers might have overlooked. Automated testing is helpful for large projects involving complicated calculations and for repeatable test cases. For features that change often and rarely executed test cases, a human tester provides a bigger ROI than automation would.",

        "answer": "The software\u2019s user interface is the only thing that the users see, touch and feel. They are not concerned about the backend code, database, or the frameworks you used to build the software. Building an application with broken, inconsistent, or annoying user interfaces can be enough to lose customers. The goal of the UI testing is to ensure that the software uses a consistent user experience and no visual or graphical elements on the screen are broken. An advanced form of UI testing also ensures that the user interface is intuitive, prevents common mistakes, and doesn\u2019t get in the way of the users getting their job done.   Typically, UI testing is performed manually by a human tester. With the advancements in the tools and frameworks in automation testing, UI testing is becoming a good candidate for automation.",

Protractor is developed by Google and is especially used for testing Angular applications.   Protractor runs the tests against the web application by running it in real web browsers. It also interacts with the application like an end-user would, e.g. clicking buttons, links, filling forms, etc., and verifying the result with the expected outcome. Since Protractor is based on the Selenium WebDriver, it\u2019s easy to perform cross-browser testing. It provides a simple API compared to Selenium, so the learning curve is not too steep. Developers can quickly get familiar with it and start writing the end-to-end UI tests. You can also take snapshots and compare them using Protractor.
