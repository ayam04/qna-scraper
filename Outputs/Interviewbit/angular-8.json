        "question": "1. Explain Lazy Loading in Angular with appropriate syntax.",
        "answer": "Lazy loading is a feature of Angular which helps in bringing down the size of large files. This is accomplished by lazily loading the files that are to be used again and again. Angular 8 provides support for dynamic imports in our router configuration. In other words, we use the import statement for lazy loading of the module and this will be understood by the webpack, IDEs (Integrated Development Environments), etc. Syntax Syntax {path: 'user', loadChildren: () =>\nimport('./users/user.module').then(my => my.UserModule)}; {path: 'user', loadChildren: () =>\nimport('./users/user.module').then(my => my.UserModule)}; Explanation Explanation In the above code snippet, the loadChildren expects a function that uses the dynamic import syntax to import the lazy loaded module only when it is needed. As is evident from the above code snippet, the dynamic import is based on promises and gives us access to the module, where the module\u2019s class can be called.",

        "question": "2. Why do applications compiled with AOT (Ahead of compilation) launch faster?",
        "answer": "Some of the reasons as to why applications compiled with AOT launch faster are as follows - Application components that are compiled with AOT execute immediately, without the client-side compilation.\nTemplates here are embedded as code within their components. Therefore, there is no client-side request for template files, making it fast.\nThe compiler does not entertain the unused Angular directives and therefore, gives a fast response. Application components that are compiled with AOT execute immediately, without the client-side compilation. Templates here are embedded as code within their components. Therefore, there is no client-side request for template files, making it fast. The compiler does not entertain the unused Angular directives and therefore, gives a fast response. Conclusion As is evident from the above set of questions, Angular has a plethora of features that it has to offer to developers. This is the reason why Angular has been growing very rapidly and being used in the software industry. Therefore, any budding developer of today, who is familiar with Angular, has a good chance of cracking technical interviews of various companies.

        "answer": "Data Binding can be best described as a technique that is used to link the application\u2019s data to the view layer. It makes communication between the DOM (Document Object Model) and the TypeScript code of our component. In other words, data binding is a communication between the typescript code of our component and our template, which is visible to the user. Data Binding allows us to define interactive applications easily and efficiently without worrying about pushing and pulling data. There are two types of data binding - There are two types of data binding - One-way data-binding: One-way data binding is used to bind the data from the component to the view (Document Object Model) or vice versa. One way data binding is a unidirectional data binding method, that is, we can either bind the data from the component to the view or bind the data from the view to the component.\nTwo-way data binding: Two-way data binding in Angular version 8 helps the users to exchange data from the component to the view and from the view to the component. Bi-directional communication is established in this method. One-way data-binding: One-way data binding is used to bind the data from the component to the view (Document Object Model) or vice versa.
