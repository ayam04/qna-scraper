        "question": "2. What is BUS Speed?",
        "answer": "A bus is a simple circuit that is used to connect one part of the motherboard to another by means of an electrical path. When a bus can handle more data at once, it will transfer data more quickly between computer components. \"Bus speed\" refers to the rate at which data can be transferred from one computer component to another. The speed of the bus can be expressed in megahertz (MHz), which indicates how much data can be transported across the bus at one time.",

DNS transforms domain names into IP addresses for browsers to access Internet resources. Every connected device to the internet has an IP address that can be used by other machines to find that device. With DNS servers, humans no longer need to memorize IP addresses like 172.158.1.16 (in IPv4), or complex addresses like 2550:ab00:2628:1::c629:d5a6 (in IPv6).",

Each zone serves a different purpose. Forward lookup zone: This zone maps hostnames to IP addresses. Whenever a computer requests an IP address by providing the hostname, the forward look-up zone is queried to obtain the IP address for that hostname. For example, if you type www.scaler.com into the address bar of your browser, the forward zone is queried and it will return the IP address 137.336.245.17, which is actually the IP address of the site you are looking at.\nReverse lookup zone: This zone maps an IP address to the hostname.

Incremental Backup Differential Backup\nAn incremental backup preserves all changes made since the previous full or incremental backup. It does not copy previously backed up files, only newly altered or created ones.

It contains information regarding how to add, modify, store, or remove the respective software. In the MSI file, you will find instructions, data, processes, and add-ons that are essential to running the application normally.
