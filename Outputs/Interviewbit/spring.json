This cannot instantiate the values partially and ensures that the dependency injection is done fully. There are two possible ways of achieving this: Annotation Configuration: This approach uses POJO objects and annotations for configuration. For example, consider the below code snippet: Annotation Configuration: @Configuration\n@ComponentScan(\"com.interviewbit.constructordi\")\npublic class SpringAppConfig {\n   @Bean\n   public Shape shapes() {\n       return new Shapes(\"Rectangle\");\n   }\n   @Bean\n   public Dimension dimensions() {\n       return new Dimension(4,3);\n   }\n} @Configuration\n@ComponentScan(\"com.interviewbit.constructordi\")\npublic class SpringAppConfig {\n   @Bean\n   public Shape shapes() {\n       return new Shapes(\"Rectangle\");\n   }\n   @Bean\n   public Dimension dimensions() {\n       return new Dimension(4,3);\n   }\n} Here, the annotations are used for notifying the Spring runtime that the class specified with @Bean annotation is the provider of beans and the process of context scan needs to be performed on the package com.interviewbit.constructordi by means of @ComponentScan annotation. Next, we will be defining a Figure class component as below: @Bean com.interviewbit.constructordi @ComponentScan @Component\npublic class Figure {\n   private Shape shape;\n   private Dimension dimension;\n   \n   @Autowired\n   public Figure(Shape shape, Dimension dimension) {\n       this.shape = shape;\n       this.dimension = dimension;\n   }\n} @Component\npublic class Figure {\n   private Shape shape;\n   private Dimension dimension;\n   \n   @Autowired\n   public Figure(Shape shape, Dimension dimension) {\n       this.shape = shape;\n       this.dimension = dimension;\n   }\n} Spring encounters this Figure class while performing context scan and it initializes the instance of this class by invoking the constructor annotated with @Autowired. The Shape and Dimension instances are obtained by calling the methods annotated with @Bean in the SpringAppConfig class. Instances of Engine and Transmission will be obtained by calling @Bean annotated methods of the Config class. Finally, we need to bootstrap an ApplicationContext using our POJO configuration: @Autowired @Bean SpringAppConfig ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(SpringAppConfig.class);\nFigure figure = context.getBean(Figure.class); ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(SpringAppConfig.class);\nFigure figure = context.getBean(Figure.class); XML Configuration: This is another way of configuring Spring runtime by using the XML configuration file. For example, consider the below code snippet in the springAppConfig.xml file: XML Configuration <bean id=\"toyota\" class=\"com.interviewbit.constructordi.Figure\">\n   <constructor-arg index=\"0\" ref=\"shape\"/>\n   <constructor-arg index=\"1\" ref=\"dimension\"/>\n</bean>\n<bean id=\"shape\" class=\"com.interviewbit.constructordi.Shape\">\n   <constructor-arg index=\"0\" value=\"Rectangle\"/>\n</bean>\n<bean id=\"dimension\" class=\"com.interviewbit.constructordi.Dimension\">\n   <constructor-arg index=\"0\" value=\"4\"/>\n   <constructor-arg index=\"1\" value=\"3\"/>\n</bean> <bean id=\"toyota\" class=\"com.interviewbit.constructordi.Figure\">\n   <constructor-arg index=\"0\" ref=\"shape\"/>\n   <constructor-arg index=\"1\" ref=\"dimension\"/>\n</bean>\n<bean id=\"shape\" class=\"com.interviewbit.constructordi.Shape\">\n   <constructor-arg index=\"0\" value=\"Rectangle\"/>\n</bean>\n<bean id=\"dimension\" class=\"com.interviewbit.constructordi.Dimension\">\n   <constructor-arg index=\"0\" value=\"4\"/>\n   <constructor-arg index=\"1\" value=\"3\"/>\n</bean> The constructor-arg tag can accept either literal value or another bean\u2019s reference and explicit index and type. The index and type arguments are used for resolving conflicts in cases of ambiguity.\nWhile bootstrapping this class, the Spring ApplicationContext needs to use ClassPathXmlApplicationContext as shown below: constructor-arg  ApplicationContext ClassPathXmlApplicationContext ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(\"springAppConfig.xml\");\nFigure figure = context.getBean(Figure.class); ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(\"springAppConfig.xml\");\nFigure figure = context.getBean(Figure.class); Setter-Based:\nThis form of DI is achieved when the Spring IoC container calls the bean\u2019s setter method after a non-parameterized constructor is called to perform bean instantiation.\nIt is possible to achieve circular dependency using setter injection.\nFor achieving this type of DI, we need to configure it through the configuration file under the <property> tag.

The DispatcherServlet does a lot more than that: It seamlessly integrates with the IoC container and allows you to use each feature of Spring in an easier manner.\nThe DispatcherServlet contacts HandlerMapping to call the appropriate Controller for processing the request on receiving it. Then, the controller calls appropriate service methods to set or process the Model data. The service processes the data and returns the view name to DispatcherServlet. DispatcherServlet then takes the help of ViewResolver and picks up the defined view for the request. Once the view is decided, the DispatcherServlet passes the Model data to View where it is finally rendered on the browser.
