Commonly used examples of models in MVC are the database, a simple object holding data (such as any multimedia file or the character of a game), a file, etc.\nA view is a way of displaying objects (user interfaces) within an application. This is the particular vertical through which end users will communicate.\nA controller is the third vertical which is responsible for updating both models and views. It accepts input from users as well as performs the equivalent update. In other words, it is the controller which is responsible for responding to user actions.
