When adding information to a file, it is done so in a specific order that has been set beforehand. If we delete some entries in the middle of other entries, the open spaces that are created as a result won't be used to make way for new records because there won't be enough room. Because of this, the amount of space used up by records that have been deleted keeps growing, and we won't be able to use these records until we use the RGZPFM command to reorganize the storage space that is currently accessible. As soon as we delete the records, the file will be reorganized, and this will cause the record numbers of the remaining records to shift relative to one another. Let's imagine that the bulk of the programs use a particular file since the value of its key is the most common one. If we want to alter the access path of this file from sequential to key, or if we want to change the key value from one to another, we can utilize GZPFM.

After locating the entries in the subfile that require validation with the help of REACDC, we will next utilize READC once more to process the data obtained from those records after ensuring that they are accurate. Unfortunately, there is just a small chance of success when using READC multiple times on the same data. Because the MDT (modified data tag) is triggered by the first READC operation that is issued on the record, the second READC action that is issued on the same record will fail. If a processing option is selected that alters specific records, READC will show you which records are affected. Because the MDT flag is going to be disabled, the records won't be considered updated for the second time because of this. Utilizing the SFLNXTCHG keyword will allow us to have the record read twice, which is necessary before it can be processed.

        "answer": "The SFLRCDNBR or SFLSIZ field in the sub-file does not include a record number that is valid. Examine the part of the programme at which it makes reference to the display subfile so that you can figure out what the value of RRN is (EXFMT). The value will be disregarded if the SFLDSP indication *ON is configured to display 0 or if the conditional display of the subfile is currently being carried out, whichever comes first. It is expected that the same error message would be displayed while making an attempt to display a subfile that is blank. There is a disparity between the location that is displayed for the field in the DDS display file and the actual location of the field. There is a lack of organization in the display file DDS's keywords. You are attempting to write more records than the Display file can hold, which is now set at 9999, but you can save no more than that. Take, for instance, the scenario in which you wished to load each and every subfile.",

This is because I/O statements can have multiple parameters. This is due to the fact that a new breakpoint is inserted for each field that is read back from the input/output buffer. This is an irritation, but it is not a major problem at all. If you include the *NODEBUGIO directive in your code, each I/O statement will fail exactly once and never again after that.",

        "question": "15. Please provide an explanation of the chain opcode in RPGLite.",
        "answer": "The READE operation will be carried out by the CHAIN command if it is unable to locate a match. CHAIN is your best bet if you have a large procedural file and are seeking a specific record (such as a record of a customer). In order to randomly access the contents of a file, we use the file operation as demonstrated by the CHAIN example. We are unable to go on from this record because none of the other records meets the conditions for the Chain operation. Therefore, if the file contains more than the given number of records that fit the same criteria, we will not be able to read any additional data using the Chain action since we will have reached our maximum capacity. The CHAIN action will lock the record that corresponds to a file whenever that file is opened in update mode. In order to avoid lock, we make use of operator extender 'N.' As part of the search input, you are required to submit either the key, the key list, or the related record number. If the record that corresponds to the search argument cannot be located, the HI level indicator will be triggered; in all other cases, it will remain deactivated. The %FOUND built-in function works in a manner that is analogous to this, giving the value '0' if there is no record found and '1' otherwise. If a CHAIN exception occurs, which is indicated by a file status code that is higher than 1000, either the operation code extender 'E' or an error indicator at the LO level needs to be used to resolve the problem. In the event that the result field does contain a specification of this kind, the operation's output will be written to the data structure that has been provided.",

        "answer": "The read operation reads all of the records that are contained within an entire procedure file. After reading the record that is now located at the pointer's location, the pointer is then moved to the next item in the sequence. When you perform a READ operation on a file that is open and set to update mode, the file receives a record lock. In order to avoid lock, we make use of operator extender 'N.' When dealing with READ exceptions, you have the option of using either the operation code extension 'E' or an error indicator at the LO level (file status codes greater than 1000). In the event that the result field does contain a specification of this kind, the operation's output will be written to the data structure that has been provided. In the case that there is an error or a circumstance that indicates that the file has reached its end, the reference to the file must be relocated to the first accessible record that is satisfactory. It is possible to reposition the pointer by utilizing the CHAIN, SETLL, or SETGT procedures. If the EOF condition is not satisfied, the Equal Indicator will not light up; instead, it will remain dark. Alternatively, the %EOF indicator may be utilized in place of this one (). ",

        "question": "18. Please provide an example of how the READC opcode is utilized in rpgle.",
        "answer": "When you use our software and press the READC button, it will retrieve any records that have been modified or added from the subfile and update the fields in the main file that are connected to the entries that were retrieved. Even if we enter a value by mistake or use the key that exits the field, the record will be altered. This is true even if no modifications were really done. As a result of the fact that this is the case, READC will also be capable of determining when something similar to this is occurring. If we make the error of entering option 3 in a field that enables user input (2 stands for edit, 4 stands for delete, and 5 stands for display), the record is modified, and READC will read this updated record. However, if we attempt to return to the record after the error has been corrected, we won't be able to do so. If we have a screen that displays records from a subfile and one of the fields in that screen allows the user to enter data, then we can delete records from the subfile. If we want to obtain the same record once more, we must first ensure that the subfile contains the most recent information and then activate the SFLNXTCHG signal. If the screen for the subfile can be modified, then any record included within the subfile can also be modified. By using READC on the subfile and including a DOW NOT%EOF in the appropriate place, we can determine which entries have been modified (). This will cause the software to read each record from the subfile that has been updated one at a time and process it.",

If the same matching criteria aren't found, it will be moved to the end of the file. The factor-1 location is where the search argument, which could be a key, relative record number, field value, named constant, or metaphorical constant, is inserted. Using SETLL and READE, it is possible to find several records all at once. Whereas CHAIN is most helpful for discovering a particular record, for example, it is feasible to retrieve several client orders for a single customer (like a customer record). Through the use of the READE command, we can read all of the records that include a match for the search input in factor -1. If there are no entries in the database that fit the search criteria, the cursor will be moved to the very end of the file. When managing READE problems, you have the option of using either the operation code extension \"E\" or an error indicator at the LO level (file status codes higher than 1000). In the event that the result field does contain a specification of this kind, the operation's output will be written to the data structure that has been provided.

        "answer": "READPE will move the record pointer back one record, read that record, and then move it back one more record while continuing to read the same record for factor 1. This process will be repeated until all records have been read. The factor-1 location is where the search argument, which could be a key, relative record number, field value, named constant, or metaphorical constant, is inserted. READPE is the best option to go with whenever it's possible to find more than one record. Reverse order searches for things like client orders can disclose multiple entries for a single consumer, whereas CHAIN is great for discovering a specific record (like a customer record). We can obtain all of the files that have a search parameter in factor-1 by using READPE. This search parameter must match the filenames that are found in the matched records. If there are no entries that correspond to the search criteria, the pointer will be moved to the beginning of the file. Dealing with READPE exceptions can be done with either the operation code extender 'E' or an error indicator at the LO level. Both of these options are available (file status codes higher than 1000).

After we have successfully set the file pointer, we are free to carry out any file operation that we desire, such as READ, READP, READPE, or READE. In addition to the literal notations *LOVAL, *HIVAL, *START, and *END, we also have the option of using RRN VALUE, KEY VALUE, and KEY LIST in factor-1.

        "answer": "When used with a search argument of factor-1, SETLL will position the file pointer at the first occurrence of the record when the value in the key field/RRN is greater than or equal to the search argument. File operations such as READ, READP,READPE, and READE are possible once the file pointer has been set. The file is moved to the end of the file if the SETLL operation fails (no records found condition). We can use the symbolic constants *LOVAL, *HIVAL, *START, *END, or the more concrete RRN VALUE, KEY VALUE, or KEY LIST in factor-1. To ascertain if the found record has a key field/RRN value that is larger than or equal to the key field, we use the %FOUND variable. The HI indicator will be \"on\" in this situation. Using %EQUAL, we check to see if the value of the key field or RRN in the found record matches the value of the search input in factor 1. Only the RRN number is required for a sequential file. Therefore, the EQ indicator will be *on in this scenario. An error indicator at the LO level or the operation code extension 'E' can be used to deal with SETLL exceptions (file status codes higher than 1000). In the event of a 100% match, the Equal Indicator will light up. That's a suitable replacement for %equal, actually (). HI level indication will be activated if a greater value match is obtained. Substitute this in for %found (). For files that aren't encrypted with a key, *LOVAL will return an error.

        "answer": "The text contained within the second input is copied over into the output field by the MOVE command. The action will begin with the character that is located in the far rightmost position of Factor 2. When sending data that pertains to dates, times, or timestamps, the first factor must be left blank unless both the source and the destination are character or numeric fields. In the event that factor 2 is longer than the result field, the leftmost letters or digits of that factor will not be sent. Any result field that is longer than factor 2 will have the leftmost letters or digits of that field remain unchanged unless padding is provided for the field. If factor 2 is smaller than the length of the result field, a P can be supplied in the operation extender position to allow the result field to be padded on the left after the move. This is only possible if the length of the result field is less than factor 2. In the instance of a result field that has a variable length, the MOVE operation will not have any impact on the length of the field. If either the source or the target is a character field, an optional separator specification can be made using the syntax indicated in factor 1 if the source or the target.

Conclusion The Logical PARtitioning-LPAR feature that was introduced in version 4.0 of OS/400 makes it possible to run several operating systems on a single IBM System, with each OS running in its own dedicated partition. This functionality was initially introduced in OS/400 version 4.0. Some of the AS400 applications, which are also known as IBM iSeries, are fairly large and call for a client-server midrange architecture, a system that is secure and stable, and virtually no maintenance. Questions around the management of supply chains, legal activity on databases, and other similar topics are also frequently asked at AS400 interviews. It's possible that the interviewer will additionally enquire about your background working with RPGLE, AS400 RPG, and AS400 testing. I hope everything works out for you!
