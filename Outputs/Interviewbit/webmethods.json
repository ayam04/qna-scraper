        "answer": "Dropping a variable from Pipeline In or Pipeline Out will remove it from the pipeline. If pipeline variables aren't being used by subsequent services, they can be dropped. By removing unneeded variables, you reduce the size of the pipeline at run time, as well as the complexity of the Pipeline In and Pipeline Out displays. This can make the Pipeline view much more usable when you are working with a complicated flow. The term \"drop pipeline\" implies an explicit cleanup. Delete is a design-time operation that removes a variable from the current view. It is only useful if you create a variable by mistake. When you change the view in developer after you delete a variable that was previously in the pipeline, the variable will appear again.",

The web service connector usually contains logic and information/data required to invoke an operation specified in a WSDL (Web Service Description Language) document used to create the consumer web service descriptor. As Integration Server creates consumer web service descriptors based on WSDL documents, it creates web service connectors for each operation the portType contains in the WSDL document. If, for example, a WSDL document contains 2 portType declarations, each of which contains 3 operations, then Integration Server creates a total of 6 web service connectors.",

        "answer": "In most cases, systems do not produce data in the exact format that other systems require, so you often need to build flow services that transform the data. When applications and systems exchange documents, data transformation resolves differences in data representations. In Designer, data transformations are accomplished through mapping. Among the types of transformation you can achieve via mapping are: Name transformations: The purpose of this transformation is to correct naming differences. By performing name transformations, the value and position of a variable remain the same in the document structure, but the variable's name is altered.\nStructural transformations: These types of transformations resolve differences in the data types or structures that represent an item. The value of the variable does not change when you perform structural transformations; only its data type or position in the Document structure changes.\nValue transformations: These types of transformations resolve differences in how values are expressed. A value transformation changes the data contained in the variable, but the variable's name and position remain the same.

All other users can read, but not modify the element until you unlock it. A system lock occurs when the server administrator marks or sets the element's supporting files (like node.xml) as read-only on the Integration Server.

In such cases, you can utilize or use the SEQUENCE step as the target step and group a series of flow steps below it (beneath). Example: An example is given below in which a service accepts a purchase order. Based on the payment type specified in the PaymentType variable, the purchase order is processed in one of three ways. Since each PO (purchase order) requires a series of steps to be completed, the targets of the BRANCH are designated as SEQUENCE steps, and the appropriate set of flow steps is listed as a child of each SEQUENCE (children beneath each SEQUENCE).
