        "question": "1. Why DevOps has become famous?",
        "answer": "These days, the market window of products has reduced drastically. We see new products almost daily. This provides a myriad of choices to consumers but it comes at a cost of heavy competition in the market. Organizations cant afford to release big features after a gap. They tend to ship off small features as releases to the customers at regular intervals so that their products don't get lost in this sea of competition. Customer satisfaction is now a motto to the organizations which has also become the goal of any product for its success. In order to achieve this, companies need to do the below things: Frequent feature deployments\nReduce time between bug fixes\nReduce failure rate of releases\nQuicker recovery time in case of release failures.\nIn order to achieve the above points and thereby achieving seamless product delivery, DevOps culture acts as a very useful tool. Due to these advantages, multi-national companies like Amazon and Google have adopted the methodology which has resulted in their increased performance.

When done properly, this phase gives various inputs required for the development and operations phases. This phase also helps the organization to gain clarity regarding the project development and management process. Tools like Google Apps, Asana, Microsoft teams, etc are used for this purpose. Development: Development: The planning phase is followed by the Development phase where the project is built by developing system infrastructure, developing features by writing codes, and then defining test cases and the automation process. Developers store their codes in a code manager called remote repository which aids in team collaboration by allowing view, modification, and versioning of the code. Tools like git, IDEs like the eclipse, IntelliJ, and technological stacks like Node, Java, etc are used. Continuous Integration (CI): Continuous Integration (CI): This phase allows for automation of code validation, build, and testing. This ensures that the changes are made properly without development environment errors and also allows the identification of errors at an initial stage. Tools like Jenkins, circleCI, etc are used here. Deployment: Deployment: DevOps aids in the deployment automation process by making use of tools and scripts which has the final goal of automating the process by means of feature activation. Here, cloud services can be used as a force that assists in upgrade from finite infrastructure management to cost-optimized management with the potential to infinite resources. Tools like Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, Heroku, etc are used.

Similarly, there are multiple myths surrounding DevOps which can contribute to antipatterns, they are: DevOps is a process and not a culture.\nDevOps is nothing but Agile.\nThere should be a separate DevOps group.\nDevOps solves every problem.\nDevOps equates to developers running a production environment.\nDevOps follows Development-driven management\nDevOps does not focus much on development.\nAs we are a unique organization, we don\u2019t follow the masses and hence we won\u2019t implement DevOps.\nWe don\u2019t have the right set of people, hence we cant implement DevOps culture.

        "question": "1. Can you explain the \u201cShift left to reduce failure\u201d concept in DevOps?",
        "answer": "In order to understand what this means, we first need to know how the traditional SDLC cycle works. In the traditional cycle, there are 2 main sides - The left side of the cycle consists of the planning, design, and development phase\nThe right side of the cycle includes stress testing, production staging, and user acceptance. The left side of the cycle consists of the planning, design, and development phase The right side of the cycle includes stress testing, production staging, and user acceptance. In DevOps, shifting left simply means taking up as many tasks that usually take place at the end of the application development process as possible into the earlier stages of application development. From the below graph, we can see that if the shift left operations are followed, the chances of errors faced during the later stages of application development would greatly reduce as it would have been identified and solved in the earlier stages itself. Shift Left To Reduce Failure  Shift Left To Reduce Failure The most popular ways of accomplishing shift left in DevOps is to: Work side by side with the development team while creating the deployment and test case automation. This is the first and the obvious step in achieving shift left. This is done because of the well-known fact that the failures that get notices in the production environment are not seen earlier quite often. These failures can be linked directly to:\nDifferent deployment procedures used by the development team while developing their features.\nProduction deployment procedures sometimes tend to be way different than the development procedure. There can be differences in tooling and sometimes the process might also be manual.\nBoth the dev team and the operations teams are expected to take ownership to develop and maintain standard procedures for deployment by making use of the cloud and the pattern capabilities. This aids in giving the confidence that the production deployments would be successful.\nUsage of pattern capabilities to avoid configurational level inconsistencies in the different environments being used. This would require the dev team and the operation team to come together and work in developing a standard process that guides developers to test their application in the development environment in the same way as they test in the production environment.

The master requests slaves to perform operations like build, test and run and produce test case reports. This workload is distributed to all the slaves in a uniform manner. Jenkins also uses multiple slaves because there might be chances that require different test case suites to be run for different environments once the code commits are done.

        "question": "5. Can you explain the \u201cinfrastructure as code\u201d (IaC) concept?",
        "answer": "As the name indicates, IaC mainly relies on perceiving infrastructure in the same way as any code which is why it is commonly referred to as \u201cprogrammable infrastructure\u201d. It simply provides means to define and manage the IT infrastructure by using configuration files. This concept came into prominence because of the limitations associated with the traditional way of managing the infrastructure. Traditionally, the infrastructure was managed manually and the dedicated people had to set up the servers physically. Only after this step was done, the application would have been deployed. Manual configuration and setup were constantly prone to human errors and inconsistencies. This also involved increased cost in hiring and managing multiple people ranging from network engineers to hardware technicians to manage the infrastructural tasks. The major problem with the traditional approach was decreased scalability and application availability which impacted the speed of request processing. Manual configurations were also time-consuming and in case the application had a sudden spike in user usage, the administrators would desperately work on keeping the system available for a large load. This would impact the application availability. IaC solved all the above problems. IaC can be implemented in 2 approaches: Imperative approach: This approach \u201cgives orders\u201d and defines a sequence of instructions that can help the system in reaching the final output.\nDeclarative approach: This approach \u201cdeclares\u201d the desired outcome first based on which the infrastructure is built to reach the final result.

        "question": "7. What is Blue/Green Deployment Pattern?",
        "answer": "A blue-green pattern is a type of continuous deployment, application release pattern which focuses on gradually transferring the user traffic from a previously working version of the software or service to an almost identical new release - both versions running on production. The blue environment would indicate the old version of the application whereas the green environment would be the new version. The production traffic would be moved gradually from blue to green environment and once it is fully transferred, the blue environment is kept on hold just in case of rollback necessity.   In this pattern, the team has to ensure two identical prod environments but only one of them would be LIVE at a given point of time. Since the blue environment is more steady, the LIVE one is usually the blue environment.",

It is referred to as that event that occurs when the cache expires (or invalidated) and multiple requests are hit to the website at the same time. The most common way of preventing dogpiling is by implementing semaphore locks in the cache. When the cache expires in this system, the first process to acquire the lock would generate the new value to the cache.",

        "question": "9. What are the steps to be undertaken to configure git repository so that it runs the code sanity checking tooks before any commits? How do you prevent it from happening again if the sanity testing fails?",
        "answer": "Sanity testing, also known as smoke testing, is a process used to determine if it\u2019s reasonable to proceed to test.\nGit repository provides a hook called pre-commit which gets triggered right before a commit happens. A simple script by making use of this hook can be written to achieve the smoke test.  The script can be used to run other tools like linters and perform sanity checks on the changes that would be committed into the repository. The following snippet is an example of one such script: #!/bin/sh\nfiles=$(git diff \u2013cached \u2013name-only \u2013diff-filter=ACM | grep \u2018.py$\u2019)\nif [ -z files ]; then\nexit 0\nfi\nunfmtd=$(pyfmt -l $files)\nif [ -z unfmtd ]; then\nexit 0\nfi\necho \u201cSome .py files are not properly fmt\u2019d\u201d\nexit 1 #!/bin/sh\nfiles=$(git diff \u2013cached \u2013name-only \u2013diff-filter=ACM | grep \u2018.py$\u2019)\nif [ -z files ]; then\nexit 0\nfi\nunfmtd=$(pyfmt -l $files)\nif [ -z unfmtd ]; then\nexit 0\nfi\necho \u201cSome .py files are not properly fmt\u2019d\u201d\nexit 1 The above script checks if any .py files which are to be committed are properly formatted by making use of the python formatting tool pyfmt. If the files are not properly formatted, then the script prevents the changes to be committed to the repository by exiting with status 1. ",

        "question": "10. How can you ensure a script runs every time repository gets new commits through git push?",
        "answer": "There are three means of setting up a script on the destination repository to get executed depending on when the script has to be triggered exactly. These means are called hooks and they are of three types: Pre-receive hook: This hook is invoked before the references are updated when commits are being pushed. This hook is useful in ensuring the scripts related to enforcing development policies are run.\nUpdate hook: This hook triggers the script to run before any updates are actually made. This hook is called once for every commit which has been pushed to the repository.\nPost-receive hook: This hook helps trigger the script after the updates or changes have been accepted by the destination repository. This hook is ideal for configuring deployment scripts, any continuous integration-based scripts or email notifications process to the team, etc. Pre-receive hook: This hook is invoked before the references are updated when commits are being pushed.
