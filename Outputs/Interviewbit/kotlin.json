        "question": "1. Explain about the \u201cwhen\u201d keyword in the context of Kotlin.",
        "answer": "The \u201cwhen\u201d keyword is used in Kotlin to substitute the switch operator in other languages such as Java. When a certain condition is met, a specific block of code must be run. Inside the when expression, it compares all of the branches one by one until a match is discovered. After finding the first match, it proceeds to the conclusion of the when block and executes the code immediately following the when block. We do not need a break statement at the end of each case, unlike switch cases in Java or any other programming language.   For example, // KOTLIN\nfun main(args: Array<String>) {\n   \n   var temp = \"Interview\"\n   when(temp) {\n       \"Interview\" -> println(\"Interview Bit is the solution.\")\n       \"Job\" -> println(\"Interview is the solution.\")\n       \"Success\" -> println(\"Hard Work is the solution.\")\n   }\n} // KOTLIN\nfun main(args: Array<String>) {\n   \n   var temp = \"Interview\"\n   when(temp) {\n       \"Interview\" -> println(\"Interview Bit is the solution.\")\n       \"Job\" -> println(\"Interview is the solution.\")\n       \"Success\" -> println(\"Hard Work is the solution.\")\n   }\n} Output:- Output:- Interview Bit is the solution. Interview Bit is the solution. Explanation:- In the above code, the variable temp has the value \u201cInterview\u201d. The when condition matches for the exact value as that of temp\u2019s and executes the corresponding code statements. Thus, \u201cInterview Bit is the solution\u201d is printed. Explanation:-",

        "question": "2. What are the advantages of Kotlin over Java?",
        "answer": "Following are the advantages of Kotlin over Java:-   Data class: In Java, you must create getters and setters for each object, as well as properly write hashCode (or allow the IDE to build it for you, which you must do every time you update the class), toString, and equals. Alternatively, you could utilize lombok, but that has its own set of issues. In Kotlin, data classes take care of everything.\nPatterns of getter and setter: In Java, for each variable, you use it for, rewrite the getter and setter methods. You don't have to write getter and setter in kotlin, and if you must, custom getter and setter take a lot less typing. There are additional delegates for identical getters and setters.\nExtension Functions: In Java, there is no support for extension functions. Kotlin on the other hand provides support for extension functions which makes the code more clear and cleaner.\nSupport for one common codebase: You may extract one common codebase that will target all of them at the same time using the Kotlin Multi-Platform framework.\nSupport for Null Safety: Kotlin has built-in null safety support, which is a lifesaver, especially on Android, which is full of old Java-style APIs.\nLess prone to errors: There is less space for error because it is more concise and expressive than Java.

        "question": "4. Differentiate between open and public keywords in Kotlin.",
        "answer": "The keyword \u201copen\u201d refers to the term \"open for expansion\". The open annotation on a class is the polar opposite of the final annotation in Java: it allows others to inherit from it. By default, a class cannot be inherited in Kotlin. In Kotlin, an open method signifies that it can be overridden, whereas it cannot be by default. Instead, any methods in Java can be overridden by default. In Kotlin, all the classes are final by default. If no visibility modifier is specified, the public is used by default, which means our declarations will be accessible everywhere inside the program.",

        "answer": "In some languages, such as Java, the static keyword is used to declare class members and utilise them without creating an object, i.e. by simply calling them by their class name. In Kotlin, there is nothing called the \u201cstatic\u201d keyword. So, if we want to achieve the functionality of static member functions, we use the companion objects. This is also referred to as Object Extension.   We must use the companion keyword in front of the object definition to construct a companion object. // Syntax in KOTLIN\nclass CompanionClass {\n\n    companion object CompanionObjectName {\n      // code\n    }\n}\nval obj = CompanionClass.CompanionObjectName // Syntax in KOTLIN\nclass CompanionClass {\n\n    companion object CompanionObjectName {\n      // code\n    }\n}\nval obj = CompanionClass.CompanionObjectName We can also remove the CompanionObject name and replace it with the term companion, resulting in the companion object's default name being Companion, as shown below: // KOTLIN\nclass CompanionClass {\n   companion object {\n     // code\n   }\n}\nval obj = CompanionClass.Companion // KOTLIN\nclass CompanionClass {\n   companion object {\n     // code\n   }\n}\nval obj = CompanionClass.Companion All the required static member functions and member variables can be kept inside the companion object created. For example, class Sample {\n   companion object Test {\n       var a: Int = 1\n       fun testFunction() = println(\"Companion Object\u2019s Member function called.\")\n   }\n}\nfun main(args: Array<String>) {\n   println(Sample.a)\n   Sample.testFunction()\n} class Sample {\n   companion object Test {\n       var a: Int = 1\n       fun testFunction() = println(\"Companion Object\u2019s Member function called.\")\n   }\n}\nfun main(args: Array<String>) {\n   println(Sample.a)\n   Sample.testFunction()\n} Output:- Output:- 1\nCompanion Object\u2019s Member function called. 1\nCompanion Object\u2019s Member function called.",

        "answer": "In Kotlin, we can add or delete method functionality using extensions, even without inheriting or altering them. Extensions are statistically resolved. It provides a callable function that may be invoked with a dot operation, rather than altering the existing class.   Function Extension - Kotlin allows users to specify a method outside of the main class via function extension. We'll see how the extension is implemented at the functional level in the following example: Function Extension - // KOTLIN\nclass Sample {\n var str : String = \"null\"\n   \n fun printStr() {\n     print(str)\n }        \n}\nfun main(args: Array<String>) {\n var  a = Sample()\n a.str = \"Interview\"\n var  b = Sample()\n b.str = \"Bit\"\n var  c = Sample()\n c.str = a.add(b)\n c.printStr()\n}\n// function extension\nfun Sample.add(a : Sample):String{\n var temp = Sample()\n temp.str = this.str + \" \" +a.str\n return temp.str\n} // KOTLIN\nclass Sample {\n var str : String = \"null\"\n   \n fun printStr() {\n     print(str)\n }        \n}\nfun main(args: Array<String>) {\n var  a = Sample()\n a.str = \"Interview\"\n var  b = Sample()\n b.str = \"Bit\"\n var  c = Sample()\n c.str = a.add(b)\n c.printStr()\n}\n// function extension\nfun Sample.add(a : Sample):String{\n var temp = Sample()\n temp.str = this.str + \" \" +a.str\n return temp.str\n} Output:- Output:- Interview Bit Interview Bit Explanation:- Explanation:- We don't have a method named \"addStr\" inside the \"Sample\" class in the preceding example, but we are implementing the same method outside of the class.

        "question": "7. How can you concatenate two strings in Kotlin?",
        "answer": "Following are the different ways by which we can concatenate two strings in Kotlin:   Using String Interpolation:- We use the technique of string interpolation to concatenate the two strings. Basically, we substitute the strings in place of their placeholders in the initialisation of the third string. Using String Interpolation:- val s1 = \"Interview\"\nval s2 = \"Bit\"\nval s3 = \"$s1 $s2\" // stores \"Interview Bit\" val s1 = \"Interview\"\nval s2 = \"Bit\"\nval s3 = \"$s1 $s2\" // stores \"Interview Bit\" Using the + or plus() operator:- We use the \u2018+\u2019 operator to concatenate the two strings and store them in a third variable. Using the + or plus() operator:- val s1 = \"Interview\"\nval s2 = \"Bit\"\nval s3 = s1 + s2 // stores \"InterviewBit\"\nval s4 = s1.plus(s2) // stores \"InterviewBit\" val s1 = \"Interview\"\nval s2 = \"Bit\"\nval s3 = s1 + s2 // stores \"InterviewBit\"\nval s4 = s1.plus(s2) // stores \"InterviewBit\" Using StringBuilder:- We concatenate two strings using the StringBuilder object. First, we append the first string and then the second string. Using StringBuilder:- val s1 = \"Interview\"\nval s2 = \"Bit\"\nval s3 =  StringBuilder()     \ns3.append(s1).append(s2)\nval s4 = s3.toString() // stores \"InterviewBit\" val s1 = \"Interview\"\nval s2 = \"Bit\"\nval s3 =  StringBuilder()     \ns3.append(s1).append(s2)\nval s4 = s3.toString() // stores \"InterviewBit\"",

        "question": "9. What are the different types of constructors available in Kotlin? Explain them with proper examples.",
        "answer": "There are two types of Kotlin constructors:   Primary Constructor  - This type of constructor is initialised in the class header and is provided after the class name. It is declared using the \u201cconstructor\u201d keyword. Parameters are optional in this type of constructor. For example, Primary Constructor  - This type of constructor is initialised in the class header and is provided after the class name. It is declared using the \u201cconstructor\u201d keyword. Parameters are optional in this type of constructor. For example, Primary Constructor  - class Sample constructor(val a: Int, val b: Int) {\n   // code\n} class Sample constructor(val a: Int, val b: Int) {\n   // code\n} If no annotations or access modifiers are provided, the constructor keyword can be omitted. The initialization code can be placed in a separate initializer block prefixed with the init keyword because the primary constructor cannot contain any code. For example, // KOTLIN\nfun main(args: Array<String>) {\n   val s1 = Sample(1, 2)\n}\nclass Sample(a : Int , b: Int) {\n   val p: Int\n   var q: Int\n   // initializer block\n   init {\n       p = a\n       q = b\n       println(\"The first parameter value is : $p\")\n       println(\"The second parameter value is : $q\")\n   }\n} // KOTLIN\nfun main(args: Array<String>) {\n   val s1 = Sample(1, 2)\n}\nclass Sample(a : Int , b: Int) {\n   val p: Int\n   var q: Int\n   // initializer block\n   init {\n       p = a\n       q = b\n       println(\"The first parameter value is : $p\")\n       println(\"The second parameter value is : $q\")\n   }\n} Output:- Output:- The first parameter value is: 1\nThe second parameter value is: 2 The first parameter value is: 1\nThe second parameter value is: 2 Explanation - The values 1 and 2 are supplied to the constructor arguments a and b when the object s1 is created for the class Sample. In the class p and q, two attributes are specified. The initializer block is called when an object is created, and it not only sets up the attributes but also prints them to the standard output.

Kotlin code will fail to build if we try to assign or return null values. If we absolutely want a null value for a variable, we can declare it as follows: value num: Int? = null  NullPointerExceptions are a big source of annoyance for Java developers. Users can assign null to any variable, however, when accessing an object reference with a null value, a null pointer exception is thrown, which the user must manage.\nCoroutines Support  We can perform long-running expensive tasks in several threads in Kotlin, but we also have coroutines support, which halt execution at a given moment without blocking threads while doing long-running demanding operations. The corresponding thread in Java will be blocked anytime we launch a long-running network I/0 or CPU-intensive task. Android is a single-threaded operating system by default. Java allows you to create and execute numerous threads in the background, but managing them is a difficult operation.\nData Classes  If we need to have data-holding classes in Kotlin, we may define a class with the keyword \"data\" in the class declaration, and the compiler will take care of everything, including constructing constructors, getter, and setter methods for various fields. Let's say we need a class in Java that only holds data and nothing else. Constructors, variables to store data, getter and setter methods, hashcode(), function toString(), and equals() functions are all required to be written explicitly by the developer.\nFunctional Programming Kotlin is procedural and functional programming (a programming paradigm where we aim to bind everything in functional units) language that has numerous useful features such as lambda expressions, operator overloading, higher-order functions, and lazy evaluation, among others. Java does not allow functional programming until Java 8, however it does support a subset of Java 8 features when developing Android apps.\nExtension Functions Kotlin gives developers the ability to add new functionality to an existing class.

        "question": "11. Explain Safe call, Elvis and Not Null Assertion operator in the context of Kotlin.",
        "answer": "Safe Call operator ( ?. ) -  Null comparisons are trivial, but the number of nested if-else expressions can be exhausting. So, in Kotlin, there's a Safe call operator,?, that simplifies things by only doing an action when a specified reference holds a non-null value. It allows us to use a single expression to perform both a null check and a method call. Safe Call operator ( ?. )   For example, The following expression in Kotlin name?.toLowerCase() name?.toLowerCase() is equivalent to the following if(name != null) \n   name.toLowerCase()\nelse\n   null if(name != null) \n   name.toLowerCase()\nelse\n   null Elvis Operator ( ?: ) - When the original variable is null, the Elvis operator is used to return a non-null value or a default value. In other words, the elvis operator returns the left expression if it is not null, otherwise, it yields the right expression. Only if the left-hand side expression is null is the right-hand side evaluated. Elvis Operator ( ?: )   For example, The following expression in Kotlin val sample1 = sample2 ?: \"Undefined\" val sample1 = sample2 ?: \"Undefined\" is equivalent to the following val sample1 = if(sample2 != null) \n       sample2\n     else \n       \"Undefined\" val sample1 = if(sample2 != null) \n       sample2\n     else \n       \"Undefined\" Furthermore, on the right side of the Elvis operator, we may use throw and return expressions, which is particularly handy in functions. As a result, instead of returning a default value on the right side of the Elvis operator, we can throw an exception. For example, val sample1 = sample2 ?: throw IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid\") val sample1 = sample2 ?: throw IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid\") Not Null Assertion Operator ( !! ) - If the value is null, the not null assertion (!!) operator changes it to a non-null type and throws an exception. Not Null Assertion Operator ( !! ) Anyone who wants a NullPointerException can ask for it explicitly with this operator. For example, // KOTLIN\nfun main(args: Array<String>) {\n   var sample : String?  = null\n   str!!.length\n} // KOTLIN\nfun main(args: Array<String>) {\n   var sample : String?  = null\n   str!!.length\n} The above code snippet gives the following output:- Exception in thread \"main\" kotlin.KotlinNullPointerException Exception in thread \"main\" kotlin.KotlinNullPointerException",

        "answer": "Kotlin's type system aims to eradicate null references from the code. If a program throws NullPointerExceptions at runtime it might result in application failure or system crashes. If the Kotlin compiler finds a null reference it throws a NullPointerException.   The Kotlin type system distinguishes between references that can hold null (nullable references) and those that cannot (non-null references). Null cannot be stored in a String variable. We get a compiler error if we try to assign null to the variable. var a: String = \"interview\"\na = null // results in compilation error var a: String = \"interview\"\na = null // results in compilation error If we want the above string to be able to hold null value as well, we can declare it of type nullable using the \u2018?\u2019 operator after the String keyword as follows : var a: String? = \"interview\"\na = null // no compilation error var a: String? = \"interview\"\na = null // no compilation error Kotlin provides Safe Call (?.), Elvis (?:) and Not Null Assertion (!!) operators which define what needs to be done in case of a null encounter.

        "answer": "Every variable in Kotlin must be declared before it can be used. An attempt to use a variable without declaring it results in a syntax error. The type of data you are authorised to put in the memory address is determined by the variable type declaration. The type of variable can be determined from the initialised value in the case of local variables. For example, var site = \"interviewbit\" var site = \"interviewbit\" The above code declares a variable \u201csite\u201d of type String because the value with which the variable is initialised is a String. There are broadly two types of variables in Kotlin. They are as follows:-   Immutable Variables \u2014 Immutable variables are also known as read-only variables. They are declared using the val keyword. Once these variables have been declared, we cannot change their values. Immutable Variables \u2014 Immutable variables are also known as read-only variables. They are declared using the val keyword. Once these variables have been declared, we cannot change their values. Immutable Variables The syntax is as follows : syntax val variableName = value val variableName = value For example, val sample = \"interview\"\nsample = \"interviewbit\"    // results in compile time error val sample = \"interview\"\nsample = \"interviewbit\"    // results in compile time error The second line in the above code snippet would result in a compile-time error as expected. Because it can be initialized with the value of a variable, an immutable variable is not a constant. It means that the value of an immutable variable does not need to be known at compile-time and that if it is defined inside a construct that is called several times, it can take on a different value with each function call. For example, var sample = \"interview\"\nval newSample = sample    // no compile time error var sample = \"interview\"\nval newSample = sample    // no compile time error The above code snippet runs fine and does not produce any errors.

This backing field is used to avoid an accessor's recursive call, which would result in a StackOverflowError. Fields are not allowed in Kotlin classes. When employing custom accessors, however, it is occasionally required to have a backing field. Kotlin includes an automatic backing field for these purposes, which may be accessed by the field identifier. For example, var marks: Int = someValue\n       get() = field\n       set(value) {\n           field = value\n       } var marks: Int = someValue\n       get() = field\n       set(value) {\n           field = value\n       } Explanation:-  Here the field identifier acts as a reference to the property \u201cmarks\u201d value in the get() and set() method.

        "answer": "Kotlin introduces a crucial new form of class that isn't seen in Java. These are referred to as \"sealed classes.\" Sealed classes, as the name implies, adhere to constrained or bounded class hierarchies. A sealed class is one that has a set of subclasses. When it is known ahead of time that a type will conform to one of the subclass types, it is employed. Type safety (that is, the compiler will validate types during compilation and throw an exception if a wrong type has been assigned to a variable) is ensured through sealed classes, which limit the types that can be matched at compile time rather than runtime.   The syntax is as follows:- sealed class className sealed class className Another distinguishing aspect of sealed classes is that their constructors are by default private. Due to the fact that a sealed class is automatically abstract, it cannot be instantiated. For example, // KOTLIN\nsealed class Sample {\n    class A : Sample() {\n        fun print()\n        {\n            println(\"This is the subclass A of sealed class Sample\")\n        }\n    }\n    class B : Sample() {\n        fun print()\n        {\n            println(\"This is the subclass B of sealed class Sample\")\n        }\n    }\n}\nfun main()\n{\n    val obj1 = Sample.B()\n    obj1.print()\n  \n    val obj2 = Sample.A()\n    obj2.print()\n} // KOTLIN\nsealed class Sample {\n    class A : Sample() {\n        fun print()\n        {\n            println(\"This is the subclass A of sealed class Sample\")\n        }\n    }\n    class B : Sample() {\n        fun print()\n        {\n            println(\"This is the subclass B of sealed class Sample\")\n        }\n    }\n}\nfun main()\n{\n    val obj1 = Sample.B()\n    obj1.print()\n  \n    val obj2 = Sample.A()\n    obj2.print()\n} Output:- Output:- This is the subclass B of sealed class Sample\nThis is the subclass A of sealed class Sample This is the subclass B of sealed class Sample\nThis is the subclass A of sealed class Sample Explanation:- In the above code, we have created a sealed class named \u201cSample\u201d and we have created two sub classes within it named \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d.

One of the most important things to remember about the suspend functions is that they can only be invoked from another suspend function or from a coroutine. Suspending functions are merely standard Kotlin functions with the suspend modifier added, indicating that they can suspend coroutine execution without blocking the current thread. This means that the code you're looking at may pause execution when it calls a suspending function and restart execution at a later time. However, it makes no mention of what will happen to the present thread in the meantime.   Suspending functions can call any other ordinary functions, but another suspending function is required to suspend the execution. Because a suspending function cannot be called from a regular function, numerous coroutine builders are supplied, allowing you to call a suspending function from a non-suspending scope like launch, async, or runBlocking. delay() function is an example of suspend function.",

There are a few easy principles to follow when deciding whether to use lateinit or lazy initialisation for property initialization: Use lateInit if properties are mutable (i.e., they may change later).\nUse lateinit if properties are set externally (for example, if you need to pass in an external variable to set it).

        "question": "9. Explain lazy initialization in the context of Kotlin.",
        "answer": "There are some classes whose object initialization is so time-consuming that it causes the entire class creation process to be delayed. Lazy initialisation helps in such problems. When we declare an object using lazy initialisation, the object is initialised only once when the object is used. If the object is not used throughout, the object is not initialised. This makes the code more efficient and faster. For example, let us imagine you have a SlowClass class and you require an object of that SlowClass in a different class called FastClass: // KOTLIN\nclass FastClass {\n   private val slowObject: SlowClass = SlowClass()\n} // KOTLIN\nclass FastClass {\n   private val slowObject: SlowClass = SlowClass()\n} We are generating a large object here, which will cause the development of the FastClass to be slow or delayed. There may be times where the SlowClass object isn't required. As a result, the lazy keyword can assist you in this situation: class FastClass {\n   private val slowObject: SlowClass by lazy {\n       SlowClass()\n   }  \n} class FastClass {\n   private val slowObject: SlowClass by lazy {\n       SlowClass()\n   }  \n} For example, // KOTLIN\nclass FastClass {\n   private val slowObject: SlowClass by lazy {\n       println(\"Slow Object initialised\")\n       SlowClass()\n   } \n   \n   fun access() {\n       println(slowObject)\n   }\n}\nfun main(args: Array<String>) {\n   val fastClass = FastClass()\n   println(\"FastClass initialised\")\n   fastClass.access()\n   fastClass.access()\n} // KOTLIN\nclass FastClass {\n   private val slowObject: SlowClass by lazy {\n       println(\"Slow Object initialised\")\n       SlowClass()\n   } \n   \n   fun access() {\n       println(slowObject)\n   }\n}\nfun main(args: Array<String>) {\n   val fastClass = FastClass()\n   println(\"FastClass initialised\")\n   fastClass.access()\n   fastClass.access()\n} Output:- Output:- FastClass initialised \nSlow Object initialised \nSlowClass@2b12fkk7 \nSlowClass@2b12fkk7 FastClass initialised \nSlow Object initialised \nSlowClass@2b12fkk7 \nSlowClass@2b12fkk7 Explanation:- In the above code, we have instantiated an object of the SlowClass inside the class structure of the FastClass using lazy initialisation. The object of the SlowClass is generated only when it is accessed in the above code, that is, when we call the access() method of the FastClass object and the same object is present throughout the main() method.

        "question": "10. What do you understand about lateinit in Kotlin? When would you consider using it?",
        "answer": "  lateinit is an abbreviation for late initiation. If you don't want to initialize a variable in the constructor and instead want to do it later, and you can guarantee the initialization before using it, use the lateinit keyword to declare that variable. It won't start allocating memory until it's been initialized. Lateinit cannot be used for primitive type attributes like Int, Long, and so on. Because the lateinit variable will be initialized later, you cannot use val. When a lateinit property is accessed before it has been initialized, a special exception is thrown that explicitly identifies the property and the fact that it hasn't been initialized. For example, // KOTLIN\nlateinit var test: String\nfun testFunction() {\n   test = \"Interview\"\n   println(\"The length of string is \"+test.length)\n   test = \"Bit\"\n} // KOTLIN\nlateinit var test: String\nfun testFunction() {\n   test = \"Interview\"\n   println(\"The length of string is \"+test.length)\n   test = \"Bit\"\n} When the testFunction is called, we get the following output:- 9 9 There are a few scenarios in which this is particularly useful, for example: Variables that are initialized in lifecycle methods in Android;\nUsing Dagger for DI: injected class variables are initialized outside of the constructor and independently;\nSetup for unit tests: in a @Before - annotated function, test environment variables are initialized;\nAnnotations in Spring Boot (for example, @Autowired).

        "question": "11. Which one is better to use - val mutableList or var immutableList in the context of Kotlin?",
        "answer": "The program's design clarity is improved by using mutable and immutable lists. This is done to have the developer think about and clarify the collection's purpose. We use a mutable list if the collection will alter as part of the design. On the other hand, we use an immutable list if the model is only meant to be viewed. Val and var serve a distinct purpose than immutable and mutable lists. The val and var keywords specify how a variable's value/reference should be handled. We use var when the value or reference of a variable can be altered at any moment. On the other hand, we use val when a variable's value/reference can only be assigned once and cannot be modified later in the execution. Immutable lists are frequently preferred for a variety of reasons: They promote functional programming, in which state is passed on to the next function, which constructs a new state based on it, rather than being altered. This is evident in Kotlin collection methods like map, filter, reduce, and so forth.\nIt's often easier to understand and debug software that doesn't have any side effects (you can be sure that the value of an object will always be the one at its definition).\nBecause no write access is required in multi-threaded systems, immutable resources cannot induce race conditions.

They are as follows : Copying large collections simply to add/remove a single piece is very expensive.\nWhen you need to alter single fields frequently, immutability can make the code more difficult. Data classes in Kotlin provide a built-in copy() method that allows you to clone an instance while changing only part of the fields' values.
