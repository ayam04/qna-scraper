Responsive variations also exist. Direction: Direction: Direction: You can use direction utilities to change the direction of a flex item in a flex container. It is not essential to create a horizontal class because it is set to row by default. To show the flex items horizontally, use .flex-row (side by side). To right-align the horizontal direction, use .flex-row-reverse. Use .flex-column to display flex items vertically (on top of each other), or .flex-column-reverse to display them in the other direction. Justify content: Justify content: Justify content: To adjust the alignment of flex elements, use the.justify-content-* classes. Start (default), end, center, between, and around are all valid classes.   Align items: Align items: Align items: You can change the vertical alignment of single rows of flex items with the .align-items-* classes. .align-items-start, .align-items-end, .align-items-center, .align-items-baseline, and .align-items-stretch (default) are valid classes.

Auto margins: Auto margins: Auto margins: You can easily add auto margins to flex items with .mr-auto which pushes items to the right, or by using .ml-auto which pushes items to the left. Grow: Grow: Grow: You can use .flex-grow-1 on a flex item to take up the unused space. In the example below, the second flex item uses all the available space since we have used the .flex-grow-1 class with the second flex item.   You can use .flex-shrink-1 on a flex item to make it shrink if required. Fill: Fill: Fill: You can use .flex-fill on flex items to make them into equal widths. Wrap: Wrap: Wrap: With .flex-nowrap (default), .flex-wrap, or .flex-wrap-reverse, you can control how flex items wrap in a flex container.    Order: Order: Order: With the .order classes, you can change the visual order of a given flex item(s). The number of valid classes ranges from 0 to 12, with the lowest number having the highest importance (order-1 is shown before order-2, etc..).
