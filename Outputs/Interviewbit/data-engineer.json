The difference between Spark and MapReduce is that Spark processes and retains data in memory for later steps, whereas MapReduce processes data on the disc. As a result, Spark's data processing speed is up to 100 times quicker than MapReduce for lesser workloads. Spark also constructs a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to schedule tasks and orchestrate nodes throughout the Hadoop cluster, as opposed to MapReduce's two-stage execution procedure.",
