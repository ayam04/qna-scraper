        "answer": "Data is sent from a non-SAP system to an SAP R/3 system via BDC (Batch Data Communication). Instead of manually entering data, a large volume of data may be added to the database of the sap tables. For recording and cursor movement, utilize the SHDB transaction (transaction code used for transaction recording in SAP). The SAP program detects this cursor movement, and the data is transferred or saved in the correct location based on our excel or flat file.   You can transmit the data using one of three techniques. BDC's methods are as follows: Batch Input Session Approach: When no other option is available, this method is utilized in ABAP programming. The online transaction procedure will be mimicked, and data will be sent in the same manner as it is done online. SHDB will be used to construct a batch input session with all of the data and screens, which will then be processed. If you make any modifications to the screen, you must include these changes in the program; otherwise, the BDC will fail.\nDirect Input Method: The data from the input file is sent directly to the SAP database using the direct input technique. It is not necessary to use any displays. To finish the task, this method will require function modules.\nCall Transaction Method: This method performs asynchronous data processing and only sends a small quantity of data. Data will be updated automatically, and processing will be faster. Errors must be addressed explicitly if you use this approach.

It is possible to construct and preserve an OLAP connection using CMC (Central Management Console) or IDT (Information Design Tool). This OLAP connection may be used with Multi-provider, BI (Business Intelligence) server, InfoCube, and BEx queries. The connection will be formed in the query or cube base if the connection is specific to a given Cube, Query, or Multi-provider. Otherwise, a connection will be formed on the BI server that may be used to connect to any BEx query.
