        "question": "1. What is an IPv4 address? What are the different classes of IPv4?",
        "answer": "An IP address is a 32-bit dynamic address of a node in the network. An IPv4 address has 4 octets of 8-bit each with each number with a value up to 255. IPv4 classes are differentiated based on the number of hosts it supports on the network. There are five types of IPv4 classes and are based on the first octet of IP addresses which are classified as Class A, B, C, D, or E.

If not, the browser checks if the IP of the URL is present in the cache (browser and OS) if not then request the OS to do a DNS lookup using UDP to get the corresponding IP address of the URL from the DNS server to establish a new TCP connection. A new TCP connection is set between the browser and the server using three-way handshaking. An HTTP request is sent to the server using the TCP connection. The web servers running on the Servers handle the incoming HTTP request and send the HTTP response. The browser process the HTTP response sent by the server and may close the TCP connection or reuse the same for future requests. If the response data is cacheable then browsers cache the same.
