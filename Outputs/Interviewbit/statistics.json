        "answer": "It is a number that helps determine the probability of a random occurrence when evaluating a hypothesis. In statistics, the p-value indicates how likely it is that a particular dataset occurred by chance. If the p-value is less than alpha, we can conclude that there is a probability of 5% that the experiment results occurred by chance or 5% of the time, we would see these results.",

        "question": "3. What is the central limit theorem?",
        "answer": "The central limit theorem is the foundation of statistics. It states that if a sample is drawn from a population with large sample size, the distribution of the sample's mean will be distributed normally. In other words, the original population distribution will not be affected. The central limit theorem is extremely useful in estimating confidence intervals and testing hypotheses. For instance, let's say I want to estimate the worldwide average height. I would take a sample of people from the general population and calculate the mean. Because it is difficult or impossible to collect data on every person's height, the mean of my sample will serve as my estimate. To create a normal curve, we can plot the mean value and the frequency on a graph and then multiply them several times. The resulting curve will be similar to the original data set, but it will be slightly shifted to the left.",

        "question": "4. What is a hypothesis test? How is the statistical significance of an insight determined?",
        "answer": "The statistical significance of an experiment's insights can be assessed using hypothesis testing. Hypothesis testing examines the probability of a given experiment's results occurring by chance. The null hypothesis is defined first, and then p-values are computed. If the null hypothesis is true, other values are determined as well. As its name suggests, the alpha value indicates the degree of significance. In a two-tailed test, the p-value is less than alpha if the null hypothesis is rejected but is greater than alpha if the null hypothesis is accepted. In a one-tailed test, the p-value is less than alpha if the null hypothesis is accepted but is greater than alpha if the null hypothesis is rejected. The rejection of the null hypothesis indicates that the results obtained are statistically significant.",

The lower the standard deviation, the less likely that a process performs accurately and commits errors. If a process delivers 99.99966% error-free results, it is said to be six sigma. A six sigma model is one that outperforms 1\u03c3, 2\u03c3, 3\u03c3, 4\u03c3, and 5\u03c3 processes and is sufficiently reliable to deliver defect-free work.",

To determine the probability of rolling a six-sided die three times, we can use this example. The outcome is far from the expected value, and if we roll the die a large number of times, we will more likely obtain our desired result closer to the expected value (3.5 in this instance).",

        "question": "5. What is the definition of selection bias?",
        "answer": "The process of selecting individual or group data in a way that is not random is known as selection bias.

        "question": "6. What does it mean by inlier?",
        "answer": "Finding an inlier in a dataset is more challenging than finding an outlier. Because finding an inlier requires external data, model accuracy is often maintained. The reduction in model accuracy caused by the presence of inliers is the same as that caused by outliers. Even when inliers are detected in the data, they are usually removed to maintain model accuracy.",

When speaking about degrees of freedom, we are referring to the number of options at our disposal when conducting an analysis. The t-distribution will shift closer to a normal distribution as DF increases.

Median: The median is the value located in the middle when the data is ordered (e.g. ordered in ascending or descending order). If n values are provided (such as x1, x2, x3,\u2026\u2026xn), then the median is x \u01aa = { x1, x2, x3,\u2026\u2026xn } .  2. Median: If n is odd, the case is I. If n is odd, the case is I.   If n is even, the case is II. If n is even, the case is II.   3. Mode: In the dataset, there may be more than one value that is the mode. Therefore, the mode is the most frequent value. 3. Mode:",
