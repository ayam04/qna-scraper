        "answer": "H1 tags can be used as many times as you like on a web page, as there is no upper or lower limit. A website's H1 (title) tag is of great importance to search engines and other machines that read the code of a web page and interpret its contents. It is generally recommended that web pages contain only one H1 tag. Multiple H1 tags can, however, be used as long as they are not overused, and are contextually relevant to the structure of the page. H1 is considered the main heading or title of an article, document, or section. It may be detrimental to the website's SEO performance if H1 elements are not used properly.",

        "question": "9. In what situations would you advise using JPEG and when would you recommend PNG?",
        "answer": "Different image compression formats use different compression techniques for different purposes. JPEG: The JPEG compression process reduces the size of an image by identifying similar colored areas; the higher the compression level, the more aggressively the process searches for these areas, which can lead to loss of visual information and artifacts at the edges of the compressed region. Colorful photos, illustrations, gradients, and other richly colored images benefit from this compression. It is particularly screenshots, flat icons, simple UI elements, and schematics.\nPNG: The PNG compression method reduces the number of colors in the image. It may result in a slight loss of color shades depending on the compression level. PNGs are excellent for UI elements, icons, signs, logos, illustrations that contain text, and screenshots. Unlike JPEGs, they also support transparent areas. In general, PNG files are bigger than JPEG files and do not offer good compression for photos and complex, colored images and gradients.

        "question": "16. What is the best way to combine fonts? How many font types should designers use on one website?",
        "answer": "In some cases, fonts work together nicely and make a good combination when displayed together. As a general rule, two fonts are compatible if they are either quite similar, but with at least one significant difference (analogous fonts), or if they are very different, but have one notable characteristic in common (complimentary fonts). The best way to combine two fonts is to look for their common and unique features (serifs, x-height, historic backgrounds, aperture, thickness, stroke contrast).\nFonts that look too similar should not be combined (e.g., Helvetica and Lucida Grande or Arial and Verdana).\nAvoid combining many font styles at once. Stick to two or three font sizes maximum; it will save you time and avoid readers skipping over the content.\nTry one serif font and one sans serif font. Especially at contrasting sizes, they tend to work well together.\nChoosing contrasting fonts is a good idea. Many ways can be used to create contrast, including weight, size, spacing, color, etc.\nIt is best to use a single font family. A superfamily contains many styles, weights, and cases within the same typeface. Sticking to one superfamily allows you to create a minimalist layout and have enough variation for your needs.
