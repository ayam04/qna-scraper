        "answer": "An engineering manager must possess the skill of team management. Interviewers ask this question to assess your leadership skills and collaboration skills as well as if you follow a specific approach to your work. Successful engineering managers are aware of their team's strengths and weaknesses. As well, they are aware of what each developer is good and bad at, so instead of assigning everyone 10 tasks, they prefer that each developer complete one task but do it flawlessly. For example, many developers prefer Agile, while others are drawn to Kanban or other SDLC models. Sample Answer: Sample Answer: \u201cAs part of the performance improvement process, I will draw up a plan to get the engineers on the speed track. Will provide personal, 1-on-1 training when required. As a team, we will discuss progress and value each suggestion. Maintain a balanced team and ensure effective communication.

        "answer": "Leadership and management differ in the following ways:   Leadership Management\nA leader is someone who leads a group of people and influences them to achieve a particular goal. A manager is responsible for planning, directing, coordinating, and controlling the activities of an organization or project.\nLeading entails having a strategic perspective, managing a team, being open-minded, and promoting innovation. A manager must possess managerial skills, communication skills, organizational skills, problem-solving skills, and conformity to the rules.\nA leader is more concerned about influencing and aligning people than with allocating tasks. Essentially, they assist individuals in envisioning the potential for future growth given their efforts in a broader context. A manager, on the other hand, achieves his/her goals by coordinating activities and implementing tactical processes. Their work involves breaking down long-term goals into smaller segments and organizing available resources to achieve the desired outcome.\nA leader creates circles of influence and inspires others. A manager creates circles of power and leads by authority.\nLeaders set directions for achieving goals. Managers set instructions for completing projects.

        "question": "18. What are the advantages of smaller teams over larger ones?",
        "answer": "The advantages of smaller teams over larger ones are as follows: Small teams are best suited to quick coordination and efficiency. Team sizes of 5 to 10 people are easier to connect and respond to changes more quickly. They jump into tasks quickly, knowing their colleagues' activities and where the product is headed. A team of this type fosters open information and knowledge exchange, as well as mutual support.\nSmall teams are more cohesive, empathic, and have better relationships. Whereas, a large group makes people lose track of each other. It takes a long time for new staff to adapt, relationships between members fade into the background, and there is less mutual support between members as the team grows. \nManaging a 5-to-10 person team gives the leader more opportunities to directly impact and motivate employees, which leads to more productive work. Leaders have a harder time evaluating the effectiveness of each individual in large groups, so staff participation drops. There is a lack of communication between large teams and their personnel does not share the values of the company. Small teams are best suited to quick coordination and efficiency.
