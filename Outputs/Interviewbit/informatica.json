Enterprise data is collected and made available for analysis, business intelligence, to derive valuable business insights, and to improve data-driven decision-making. Data contained here can be accessed and utilized by users (with privileges) across the organization. With EDW, data is accessed through a single point and delivered to the server via a single source.  ",

        "answer": "Transformations in Informatica are the repository objects that transform the source data according to the needs of the target system and ensure that the quality of loaded data is maintained. The following transformations are provided by Informatica to accomplish specific functionalities: Aggregator Transformation: An active transformation used to compute averages and sums (especially across multiple rows or groups).\nExpression transformation: A passive transformation suitable for calculating values in one row. In addition, conditional statements can be tested before they are written to target tables or other transformations.\nFilter transformation: An active transformation used for filtering rows in mappings that don't meet the given condition.\nJoiner transformation: An active transformation joins data from different sources or from the same location.\nLookup transformation: In order to get relevant data, a lookup transformation looks up a source, source qualifier, or target. Results of the lookup are returned to another transformation or the target object. Active Lookup transformation returns more than one row, whereas passive transformation returns only a single row.\nNormalizer transformation: An active transformation used for normalizing records sourced from Cobol sources whose data is usually in de-normalized format. A single row of data can be transformed into multiple rows using it.\nRank transformation: An active transformation used to select top or bottom rankings.\nRouter transformation: An active transformation provides multiple conditions for testing the source data.\nSorter transformation: An active transformation sorts data according to a field in ascending or descending order. Additionally, to set case-sensitive sorting.\nSequence Generator transformation: A passive transformation used to generate numeric values. Each record in the table is uniquely identified by creating unique primary keys or surrogate keys.\nSource Qualifier transformation: An active transformation reads rows from a flat-file or relational source while running a session and adds them to mapping. Using this tool, Source Data Types are transformed into Informatica Native Data Types\nStored Procedure transformation: A passive transformation used to automate time-consuming processes or labor-intensive tasks. Additionally, used to handle errors, determine the database space, drop and recreate indexes, and perform specialized calculations.\nUpdate strategy transformation: An active transformation used to update data in a target table, either to maintain its history or incorporate recent updates.

Your preparation is the key to a successful tech interview. You must be thorough, whether you are searching within your own domain or for what the company is looking for. Here are a few tips which will significantly improve your preparation process. Do some research on the company: You should have a basic understanding of how Informatica has evolved over time. Informatica's mission, values, and goals should be familiar to you when you attend interviews. Researching an organization's culture is also very important. Talking about the culture and values of an organization during an interview will help recruiters see you as a good match. Research the products offered by Informatica and its areas of focus so you know what to expect if you're selected. \nPrepare Well: Practice the kinds of questions that will likely be asked before attending an interview. The technical interview includes a number of questions related to coding, computer fundamentals like DSA, computer networks, systems design, etc. Prepare all in advance and clarify your data warehouse concepts also. Since Informatica will be used in the same project, the interviewer is certain to ask to discuss these concepts. In addition to technical interviews, there are also behavioral interviews. They are designed to help employers assess your behavior in specific situations and to see if you're a good fit. Preparing for these interview sessions is often overlooked, but they are just as important as the technical sessions.\nBe passionate: Demonstrate your value, particularly in HR. Interviewers should be able to see why you would be a great member of their company. Your passion for coding and ability to create new programs demonstrate why you are the best candidate for the job. \nDon't let mistakes bother you: Ask questions and get clarification when you need it. Don't let a mistake affect your interview. Many questions will be asked and the interviewer will often overlook a mistake. So, if something goes wrong, move on to the next part of the interview. If you aren't sure of an answer to a question, be honest about it. You should interact with the interviewer for more information on the topic. \nPractice, Practice, Practice: Interviews can be challenging and hard to prepare for. It is necessary, however, to practice what you preach in order to increase your chance of success. Make sure you practice both technical and behavioral interviews. Data software such as Informatica is widely used around the world. You would, therefore, be well advised to stay up to date with the latest developments of this software.
