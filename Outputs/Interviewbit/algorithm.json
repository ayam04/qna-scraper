        "answer": "Depth First Search or DFS is a technique for traversing or exploring data structures such as trees and graphs. The algorithm starts at the root node (in the case of a graph, any random node can be used as the root node) and examines each branch as far as feasible before retracing. So the basic idea is to start at the root or any arbitrary node and mark it, then advance to the next unmarked node and repeat until there are no more unmarked nodes. After that, go back and check for any more unmarked nodes to cross. Finally, print the path's nodes. The DFS algorithm is given below: Step1: Create a recursive function that takes the node's index and a visited array as input.\nStep 2: Make the current node a visited node and print it.\nStep 3: Call the recursive function with the index of the adjacent node after traversing all nearby and unmarked nodes.

        "answer": "It is a trick question that is frequently asked in the interviews of various companies. This problem can be solved in a variety of ways. However, while solving the problem, we must solve it without using a temporary variable, which is an essential condition. For this problem, if we can consider the possibility of integer overflow in our solution while coming up with an approach to solving it, we can make a great impression on interviewers. Let us say that we have two integers a and b, with a's value equal to 5 and b's value equal to 6, and we want to swap them without needing a third variable. We will need to use Java programming constructs to solve this problem. Mathematical procedures such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be used to swap numbers. However, it is possible that it will cause an integer overflow problem. Let us take a look at two approaches to solve this problem: Using Addition and subtraction: Using Addition and subtraction: a = a + b;\nb = a - b; // this will act like (a+b) - b, and now b equals a.\na = a - b; // this will act like (a+b) - a, and now an equals b. a = a + b;\nb = a - b; // this will act like (a+b) - b, and now b equals a.\na = a - b; // this will act like (a+b) - a, and now an equals b. // this will act like (a+b) - b, and now b equals a. // this will act like (a+b) - a, and now an equals b. It is a clever trick. However, if the addition exceeds the maximum value of the int primitive type as defined by Integer.MAX_VALUE in Java, or if the subtraction is less than the minimum value of the int primitive type as defined by Integer.MIN_VALUE in Java, there will be an integer overflow. Using the XOR method: Using the XOR method: Another way to swap two integers without needing a third variable (temporary variable) is using the XOR method. This is often regarded as the best approach because it works in languages that do not handle integer overflows, such as Java, C, and C++. Java has a number of bitwise operators. XOR (denoted by ^) is one of them. x = x ^ y; \ny = x ^ y; \nx = x ^ y; x = x ^ y; \ny = x ^ y; \nx = x ^ y;",

        "answer": "Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. Heapsort is similar to selection sort in that it separates its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, then successively decreases the unsorted part by taking the largest element from it and putting it into the sorted region. Unlike selection sort, heapsort does not waste time scanning the unsorted region in linear time; instead, heap sort keeps the unsorted region in a heap data structure to identify the largest element in each step more rapidly. Let us take a look at the heap sort algorithm: The Heapsort algorithm starts by converting the list to a max heap. The algorithm then swaps the first and last values in the list, reducing the range of values considered in the heap operation by one, and filters the new first value into its heap place. This process is repeated until the range of values considered is only one value long. On the list, use the buildMaxHeap() function. This function, also known as heapify(), creates a heap from a list in O(n) operations.\nChange the order of the list's first and last elements. Reduce the list's considered range by one.\nTo sift the new initial member to its appropriate index in the heap, use the siftDown() function on the list.\nUnless the list's considered range is one element, proceed to step 2.

Unless the list's considered range is one element, proceed to step 2. Note: The buildMaxHeap() operation runs only one time with a linear time complexity or O(n) time complexity. The siftDown() function works in O(log n) time complexity, and is called n times. Therefore, the overall time complexity of the heap sort algorithm is O(n + n log (n)) = O(n log n). Note: The buildMaxHeap() operation runs only one time with a linear time complexity or O(n) time complexity. The siftDown() function works in O(log n) time complexity, and is called n times.

        "question": "10. Explain the Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between a given node in a graph to any other node in the graph.",
        "answer": "Dijkstra's algorithm is a method for determining the shortest pathways between nodes in a graph, which might be used to depict road networks. Edsger W. Dijkstra, a computer scientist, conceived it in 1956 and published it three years later. There are numerous variations of the algorithm. The original Dijkstra algorithm discovered the shortest path between two nodes, but a more frequent form fixes a single node as the \"source\" node and finds the shortest pathways from the source to all other nodes in the network, resulting in a shortest-path tree. Let us take a look at Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between a given node in a graph to any other node in the graph: Let us call the node where we are starting the process as the initial node. Let the distance from the initial node to Y be the distance of node Y. Dijkstra's algorithm will begin with unlimited distances and attempt to improve them incrementally. Step 1: Mark all nodes that have not been visited yet. The unvisited set is a collection of all the nodes that have not been visited yet.\nStep 2: Assign a tentative distance value to each node: set it to zero for our first node and infinity for all others. The length of the shortest path discovered so far between the node v and the initial node is the tentative distance of a node v. Because no other vertex other than the source (which is a path of length zero) is known at the start, all other tentative distances are set to infinity. Set the current node to the beginning node.\nStep 3: Consider all of the current node's unvisited neighbours and determine their approximate distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and choose the one that is less. If the present node A has a distance of 5 and the edge linking it to a neighbour B has a length of 3, the distance to B through A will be 5 +3 = 8. Change B to 8 if it was previously marked with a distance greater than 8. If this is not the case, the current value will be retained.\nStep 4: Mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set once we have considered all of the current node's unvisited neighbours. A node that has been visited will never be checked again.\nStop if the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance between the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal; occurs when there is no connection between the initial node and the remaining unvisited nodes). The algorithm is now complete.\nStep 5: Otherwise, return to step 3 and select the unvisited node indicated with the shortest tentative distance as the new current node. Step 1: Mark all nodes that have not been visited yet. The unvisited set is a collection of all the nodes that have not been visited yet. Step 2: Assign a tentative distance value to each node: set it to zero for our first node and infinity for all others.

Step 3: Consider all of the current node's unvisited neighbours and determine their approximate distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and choose the one that is less. If the present node A has a distance of 5 and the edge linking it to a neighbour B has a length of 3, the distance to B through A will be 5 +3 = 8. Change B to 8 if it was previously marked with a distance greater than 8. If this is not the case, the current value will be retained. Step 4: Mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set once we have considered all of the current node's unvisited neighbours.

The algorithm is now complete. Step 5: Otherwise, return to step 3 and select the unvisited node indicated with the shortest tentative distance as the new current node.   It is not required to wait until the target node is \"visited\" as described above while constructing a route: the algorithm can end once the destination node has the least tentative distance among all \"unvisited\" nodes (and thus could be selected as the next \"current\"). For arbitrary directed graphs with unbounded non-negative weights, Dijkstra's algorithm is asymptotically the fastest known single-source shortest path algorithm with time complexity of O(|E| + |V|log(|V|)), where  |V| is the number of nodes and|E| is the number of edges in the graph.",

        "question": "13. Describe the quick sort algorithm.",
        "answer": "Quicksort is a sorting algorithm that is in place (in-place algorithm is an algorithm that transforms input using no auxiliary data structure). It was created by the British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959 and was published in 1961, and it is still a popular sorting algorithm. It can be somewhat quicker than merge sort and two or three times faster than heapsort when properly done. Quicksort is based on the divide and conquer algorithmic paradigm. It operates by picking a 'pivot' element from the array and separating the other elements into two subarrays based on whether they are greater or less than the pivot. As a result, it is also known as partition exchange sort. The subarrays are then recursively sorted. This can be done in place, with only a little amount of additional RAM (Random Access Memory) required for sorting. Quicksort is a comparison sorting algorithm, which means it can sort objects of any type that have a \"less-than\" relation (technically, a total order) declared for them. Quicksort is not a stable sort, which means that the relative order of equal sort items is not retained in efficient implementations. Quicksort (like the partition method) must be written in such a way that it can be called for a range within a bigger array, even if the end purpose is to sort the entire array, due to its recursive nature. The following are the steps for in-place quicksort: If there are less than two elements in the range, return immediately because there is nothing else to do. A special-purpose sorting algorithm may be used for other very small lengths, and the rest of these stages may be avoided.\nOtherwise, choose a pivot value, which is a value that occurs in the range (the precise manner of choice depends on the partition routine, and can involve randomness).\nPartition the range by reordering its elements while determining a point of division so that all elements with values less than the pivot appear before the division and all elements with values greater than the pivot appear after it; elements with values equal to the pivot can appear in either direction. Most partition procedures ensure that the value that ends up at the point of division is equal to the pivot, and is now in its ultimate location because at least one instance of the pivot is present (but termination of quicksort does not depend on this, as long as sub-ranges strictly smaller than the original are produced).\nApply the quicksort recursively to the sub-range up to the point of division and the sub-range after it, optionally removing the element equal to the pivot at the point of division from both ranges. (If the partition creates a potentially bigger sub-range near the boundary with all elements known to be equal to the pivot, these can also be omitted.)

Quicksort's mathematical analysis reveals that, on average, it takes O(nlog (n) time complexity to sort n items. In the worst-case scenario, it performs in time complexity of O(n^2). Note: The algorithm's performance can be influenced by the partition routine (including the pivot selection) and other details not fully defined above, possibly to a large extent for specific input arrays. It is therefore crucial to define these alternatives before discussing quicksort's efficiency.
