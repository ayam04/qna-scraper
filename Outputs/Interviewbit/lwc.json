        "question": "1. What is the role of the Lightning Message Service in LWC?",
        "answer": "The Lightning Message Service in LWC provides a way for components to communicate with each other using a publish-subscribe messaging model. It consists of a message channel and message payload, that helps components to send and receive messages in a loosely coupled manner. Components can subscribe to a channel to receive messages and can send messages on a specific channel to any other component that has subscribed to that channel. For example - Suppose, there is a parent component that has two child components. One child component is responsible for displaying a list of items, while the other child component is responsible for displaying the details of the selected item. When the user selects an item from the list, the first child component can send a message on a specific channel with the details of the selected item. The second child component, which has subscribed to the same channel, can receive the message and update its display with the new details. For example Parent Component Parent Component <template>\n    <c-item-list onitemselect={handleItemSelect}></c-item-list>\n    <c-item-details></c-item-details>\n</template> <template>\n    <c-item-list onitemselect={handleItemSelect}></c-item-list>\n    <c-item-details></c-item-details>\n</template> Child-1 Component Child-1 Component <template>\n    <ul>\n        <template for:each={items} for:item=\"item\">\n            <li key={item.id} onclick={handleItemClick} data-item-id={item.id}>{item.name}</li>\n        </template>\n    </ul>\n</template> <template>\n    <ul>\n        <template for:each={items} for:item=\"item\">\n            <li key={item.id} onclick={handleItemClick} data-item-id={item.id}>{item.name}</li>\n        </template>\n    </ul>\n</template> Child-2 Component Child-2 Component <template>\n    <div if:true={selectedItem}>\n        <h2>{selectedItem.name}</h2>\n        <p>{selectedItem.description}</p>\n    </div>\n    <div if:false={selectedItem}>\n        <p>Please select an item from the list.</p>\n    </div>\n</template> <template>\n    <div if:true={selectedItem}>\n        <h2>{selectedItem.name}</h2>\n        <p>{selectedItem.description}</p>\n    </div>\n    <div if:false={selectedItem}>\n        <p>Please select an item from the list.</p>\n    </div>\n</template> All these template components, we can initialize into the render() function. So, When the user selects an item from the list in the first child component, the second child component should receive a message containing the details of the selected item and update its display accordingly.",

        "question": "3. Can you explain the role of the Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) in LWC?",
        "answer": "SOQL is a query language used in Lightning Web Components (LWC) to retrieve data from the Salesforce database. It allows developers to customize the data they retrieve by using filters, ordering, and grouping clauses, and accessing related objects. In LWC, SOQL is frequently used to retrieve data from Salesforce objects and display it in a user interface. The wire adapters and imperative Apex calls in LWC provide developers with ways to make server-side calls to retrieve data using SOQL, offering flexibility and control over query execution. Overall, SOQL enables developers to create dynamic and customized user interfaces in LWC that meet the specific needs of users. For example - Suppose we need to extract some record with the particular \u201crecordID\u201d, then the code will be - For example - \u201crecordID\u201d import { LightningElement, wire } from 'lwc';\nimport { getRecord } from 'lightning/uiRecordApi';\nimport ACCOUNT_OBJECT from '@salesforce/schema/Account';\nimport NAME_FIELD from '@salesforce/schema/Account.Name';\n\nexport default class SoqlExample extends LightningElement {\n    @wire(getRecord, { recordId: '001xx000003Dk9rAAC', fields: [NAME_FIELD] })\n    account;\n\n    get accountName() {\n        return this.account.data.fields.Name.value;\n    }\n} import { LightningElement, wire } from 'lwc';\nimport { getRecord } from 'lightning/uiRecordApi';\nimport ACCOUNT_OBJECT from '@salesforce/schema/Account';\nimport NAME_FIELD from '@salesforce/schema/Account.Name';\n\nexport default class SoqlExample extends LightningElement {\n    @wire(getRecord, { recordId: '001xx000003Dk9rAAC', fields: [NAME_FIELD] })\n    account;\n\n    get accountName() {\n        return this.account.data.fields.Name.value;\n    }\n} In this example, we're using the getRecord wire adapter from the lightning/uiRecordApi module to fetch the Name field of an Account record with the ID 001xx000003Dk9rAAC. getRecord lightning/uiRecordApi 001xx000003Dk9rAAC. The \u201crecordId\u201d parameter is set to the ID of the record we want to fetch, and the fields parameter is set to an array containing the NAME_FIELD constant, which represents the Name field of the Account object. \u201crecordId\u201d NAME_FIELD constant,",

        "answer": "In LWC, the @AuraEnabled(cacheable=true) annotation is used to cache the server's response on the client side, making subsequent calls to the same server method faster and more efficient. @AuraEnabled(cacheable=true) When a server method is marked as cacheable, the Lightning Platform stores the method's response in the client's cache. If the same method is called again with the same parameters, the Lightning Platform can retrieve the response from the cache instead of making a new server call. This can improve performance and reduce network traffic. Consider the below example to use this annotation. import { LightningElement, wire } from 'lwc';\nimport { getRecord } from 'lightning/uiRecordApi';\nconst FIELDS = ['Account.Name', 'Account.Phone'];\nexport default class AccountDetails extends LightningElement {\n    accountId = '001XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX';\n\n    @wire(getRecord, { recordId: '$accountId', fields: FIELDS })\n    account;\n    get name() {\n        return this.account.data.fields.Name.value;\n    }\n    get phone() {\n        return this.account.data.fields.Phone.value;\n    }\n} import { LightningElement, wire } from 'lwc';\nimport { getRecord } from 'lightning/uiRecordApi';\nconst FIELDS = ['Account.Name', 'Account.Phone'];\nexport default class AccountDetails extends LightningElement {\n    accountId = '001XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX';\n\n    @wire(getRecord, { recordId: '$accountId', fields: FIELDS })\n    account;\n    get name() {\n        return this.account.data.fields.Name.value;\n    }\n    get phone() {\n        return this.account.data.fields.Phone.value;\n    }\n} In this example, the \u2018getRecord\u2019 function is marked as cacheable by using the \u2018@AuraEnabled(cacheable=true)\u2019 annotation.

        "question": "1. What is the role of the Shadow DOM in LWC, and how does it differ from the traditional DOM?",
        "answer": "In LWC, the Shadow DOM is used to encapsulate the component's DOM hierarchy and prevent CSS styles and JavaScript code from bleeding out of the component and interfering with the rest of the page. The Shadow DOM is a part of the web standards and it is supported by modern browsers. It allows the creation of a separate DOM tree inside the component that is hidden from the outside world. This way, the component's styles, and behaviour are self-contained and it doesn't affect other parts of the page. In contrast to the traditional DOM, which is global and mutable, the Shadow DOM is local and immutable. It isolates the component's styles and behaviour from the rest of the page, making it easier to maintain and test the component in isolation. When we create an LWC component, its HTML template, and CSS styles are automatically encapsulated in the Shadow DOM. The JavaScript code can access the Shadow DOM via the \u201cthis.template\u201d property, but it cannot access the rest of the page's DOM directly. Conclusion LWC is a powerful and flexible framework for building modern, lightweight web applications on the Salesforce platform. It offers many benefits, such as better performance, improved developer productivity, and easier integration with external systems. However, mastering LWC requires a deep understanding of its core concepts and best practices, as well as the ability to write clean, modular, and reusable code. So if you are preparing for an LWC interview, it is essential to have a solid grasp of the framework fundamentals. Additionally, you should be able to demonstrate your experience in designing and building complex LWC components, as well as your ability to debug and troubleshoot issues. By studying and practising these LWC interview questions, you can gain the knowledge and skills you need to excel in your next LWC job interview and make a significant contribution to your team and organization.",

We also set the isSubscribe parameter to true, which means that this component will be able to subscribe to messages published on this channel. createMessageChannel() isSubscribe true Publish a message: After defining a message channel, we can publish messages on that channel using the publish() method. Publish a message: After defining a message channel, we can publish messages on that channel using the publish() method.

        "answer": "The LWC component cache is an important feature that can help in improving the performance of Lightning Web Components. Consider the scenario behind the rendering of the component - When a user loads a page that contains LWC components, the browser needs to download and render those components. This usually takes some time, especially if the user has a slow internet connection or is accessing the page for the first time. This problem can be solved using the LWC component cache. This helps speed up this process by storing copies of the components in the browser's cache. So, in the case when the browser does not need to download the components every time the user accesses the page. Instead of this, the cached components can be quickly retrieved and displayed. This helps in reducing page load time and improves the user experience. To enable the LWC component cache,  we need to use the @wire decorator with the getRecord or getListUi wire adapters. These adapters automatically cache the results of the wire call in the browser's cache, which can help improve performance. @wire getRecord getListUi",

Once we have the component,  then we need to create the Lightning App itself. There are a few different tools we can use for this, like using the Salesforce Developer Console or the Salesforce CLI to create your app. Once the app is created, we can then embed the LWC component (that we have created initially) within it. This involves referencing the component within the app using a specific syntax. We also want to configure the app to ensure that it is set up correctly and that any necessary event handling is in place. We can include the component like this - <aura:application extends=\"force:slds\">\n    <c:myLwcComponent />\n</aura:application> <aura:application extends=\"force:slds\">\n    <c:myLwcComponent />\n</aura:application> In the above snippet, we have the component (myLwcComponent).
