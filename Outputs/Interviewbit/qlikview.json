        "question": "1. What are the essential QlikView features?",
        "answer": "QlikView has many features that help you quickly create advanced reports from multiple data sources. Below are some of the features that make QlikView unique: Natural analytics and data discovery: QlikView searches through all the data stored in the memory in a natural manner. Natural search means that the data searching process does not follow predefined patterns, but instead will search for data and associations in a way that is the most natural. Within QlikView apps, users can quickly discover and analyze data.\nData collaboration and connectivity: Qlik DataMarket (DaaS) is a unique QlikView cloud-based data service that allows users to fetch data sets from different syndicated and public data sources. Several public datasets are available, including population, currencies, business demographics, weather conditions, economic indicators, etc. RESTful API connectors can also be used to connect and integrate with data sources like Facebook, Alfresco, Twitter, LinkedIn, Adobe, Documentum, etc.\nData association is automatically maintained: QlikView recognizes or identifies the relationship between every piece of data in a dataset automatically. Therefore, users do not have to pre-configure relationships between data entities.\nIn-memory storage capability: In-memory storage technology is one of QlikView's key strengths. Data from different sources (including traditional sources like data warehouses) are loaded or stored into RAM on the system and can later be retrieved directly from there.\nAssociative model: QlikView is the only tool that offers an associative data discovery model. It simplifies the process of discovering and analyzing data in BI tools. As a result of these associations, we create a logical connection by linking related data fields and data values with each other.\nComparative Analysis: Comparative analysis in QlikView is an extension of the associative model. Comparisons of different fields and data sets are possible through comparative analysis. Users and developers can choose which data sections or states to compare. The comparison of data is aided by charts, tables, and graphs for better understanding and analysis.

Mesokurtic (Kurtosis=3) distributions are defined as distributions whose shape lies between the leptokurtic distribution and the platykurtic distribution. Kurtosis():   Skew(): This function measures the asymmetry of a distribution curve. A zero value of skewness causes the distribution curve to split into two equal halves at the median. Negative values of the skewness cause the distribution to have a longer tail towards the left side of the curve.

There is also a search feature, which allows you to find specific values within a list box. This is very useful when you have a very long list of values.\nMulti-Box: This type of box displays all the values from multiple fields as drop-down values. This is a compressed table box that displays only the field names in the columns and allows you to view all values of a particular field by using a drop-down menu. This box allows you to save a lot of space on your dashboard or sheet while adding more objects to the dashboard for better analytics. When a value is selected in the list box, the related values in the other sheet objects are highlighted. This speeds up visually analyzing a sheet. Additionally, you can follow drill-down paths among various sheet objects. List Box: Using a list box, you can choose a single field from a table that has been loaded into QlikView memory. As a result, you will see a single list of values for the field you have selected.  When a value is selected in the list box, the related values in the other sheet objects are highlighted. There is also a search feature, which allows you to find specific values within a list box. This is very useful when you have a very long list of values.

        "question": "10. Explain what a join is and write its types.",
        "answer": "The join command in QlikView makes it possible to combine data from two separate data sets into a single set. A join in QlikView is similar to a join in SQL. When the output is generated, only columns and rows whose values match the join conditions are displayed. There are three types of joins as follows: Inner Join: With this join, only the rows present in both tables (left and right) are merged and displayed as a single table.\nOuter Join: With this join, all the rows present in both tables (left and right) are merged into and displayed as a single table.\nLeft Join: This involves retrieving all the rows from the left table and only the rows matching from the right table.\nRight Join: This involves retrieving all the rows from the right table and only the rows matching from the left table.

        "answer": "To access or open a QlikView document from a QlikView Server (QVS), each client/user requires its own license. A Client Access License (CAL) enables access to QlikView documents residing on a QlikView Server. For CALs, you need a QlikView Publisher license. The following types of CALs are available in QlikView: Named User CAL: With Named User CAL, a single named user can have access to all QlikView documents on the QlikView Server for as long as required. Named user CALs are specific to the machine or the user. While this license cannot be shared, it allows users to access any number of documents for an unlimited amount of time.\nDocument CAL: With Document CAL, a single named user can access only a single QlikView document on the QlikView Server at any time. A single user can be assigned multiple Document CALs. \nSession CAL: In a scenario where there are a great number of non-frequent users, session CALs are used. With the Session CAL, a single named or anonymous user has access to all the QlikView documents on the QlikView server. Sessions CALs comprise a pool of licenses that are assigned automatically to users or clients based on the first-come, first-served.\nUsage CAL: With the Usage CAL, a single named or anonymous user has access to a single QlikView document on the QlikView server for 60 minutes every 28 days.

        "question": "14. In QlikView, what types of tables are there?",
        "answer": "Tables are the most common way of presenting data. Tables in QlikView can be categorized into four types: pivot tables, crosstables, straight tables, and mapping tables. All of these types of QlikView tables display data uniquely. Pivot table: Table pivots are commonly used to show the sum of values across several dimensions in a table. It can be used in data analysis. You can create pivot tables using chart objects.\nStraight table: Straight tables are the most basic form of data representation in QlikView. Simple yet powerful, these tables allow you to rearrange columns, sort them, and colour the background.\nCrosstable: Cross tables are tables where the columns and rows swap or switch places. The row\u2019s values repeat themselves for every column value in a cross table. You can create a cross table in the File Wizard.\nMapping table: This table maps the column values of two tables. Alternatively, it is referred to as a lookup table, which is only used to locate a related value in another table. A mapping table is temporarily created in memory and is automatically dropped after script execution is complete.

        "answer": "There are various types of charts available in QlikView. Some of them are as follows: Bar chart: It shows numerical data values as blocks of varying sizes. Bar charts display categories on the x-axis and the corresponding calculated values on the y-axis, such as sums, counts, and averages.\nLine chart: Line charts connect numerical values to present information. A line chart presents information using a series of data points with a continuous line.\nCombo chart: This type of chart combines bar charts and line charts. There will be two measures displayed in a category, one by a line and one by a bar.\nFunnel chart: A graphic showing the progression of a process or a flow of data. \nBlock Chart: The block chart shows a relationship between measure values as blocks. The area of each block depends on the measured value.\nMekko chart: Mekko charts are like bar charts but with varying widths. The data is represented by bars of different sizes and widths.\nGauge chart: The gauge chart shows the value of a single expression without any dimensions.  Gauge charts are used to measure various aspects of a business, such as the profit earned, total quantity sold, etc., using gauge meters.  By setting the maximum & minimum range of gauge meters, you can assess your performances accordingly. Bar chart: It shows numerical data values as blocks of varying sizes.
