        "answer": "We use a ticker to tell how often our animation is refreshed in Flutter. Signals are sent at a constant frequency, such as 60 times per second, using this type of signal-sending class. We understand it better with our watch, which ticks constantly. For each tick, a callback method is provided that has the time since the first tick at each second since it was started. The tickers are synchronized immediately, even if they begin at different times.",

Flutter's tooling allows the application to be compiled in three modes. Depending on our stage of development, we may choose between these compilation modes. Debug Mode: This mode enables debugging of apps on a physical device, emulator, or simulator. Assertions and service extensions are enabled here. Quick deployment is then achieved by optimizing compilation. \nProfile Mode: In this mode, some debugging abilities are maintained, enough to analyze the app's performance while testing.  Tracing and some extensions are enabled in this case. On emulators and simulators, profile mode is disabled since their behavior does not reproduce real-world performance. The following command can be used to compile the profile mode: flutter run --profile \nRelease Mode: When deploying the app, this mode is used to minimize the size of the footprint and maximize optimization.

In Flutter, you must write code inside a widget in order to build anything. With the widget, you can see how your app would appear with its current configuration. As soon as you modify the code, the widget will rebuild its description based on the difference between the old and new widget, and the changes will sync up with the UI of the app. The Flutter widget can be created as follows: Class ImageWidget extends StatelessWidget {   \n    // Class Stuff   \n} Class ImageWidget extends StatelessWidget {   \n    // Class Stuff   \n} The app is built by nesting widgets within each other.

In other words, it ensures that the widget design, rendering, and interaction with other widgets are up to the mark.   \nIntegration tests:  Using Integration testing, you can test the critical flows of the entire app. It is important to check whether all widgets and services work together as expected. You can also use it to measure and benchmark the performance of your app. Unit tests: Using unit testing, you can test a class or method.

        "question": "7. What is state management?",
        "answer": "Whether you are building a mobile app or a web application, State Management is crucial. Using it, states of various UI controls are centralized to handle data flow across an application. It can be a text field, radio button, checkbox, dropdown, toggle, form, and so on. In Flutter, state management can be categorized into two types as follows: Ephemeral State: Ephemeral state is also called UI state or local state, and it pertains to a particular widget. In other words, it is a state that is contained within the specific widget. By means of StatefulWidget, Flutter provides support for this state.\nApp State: This is different from the ephemeral state since it is a state that we intend to share across different parts of the app and which we want to maintain between sessions. These types of states can thus be used globally. By means of scoped_model, Flutter provides support for this state. Ephemeral State: Ephemeral state is also called UI state or local state, and it pertains to a particular widget. In other words, it is a state that is contained within the specific widget.

        "question": "8. Explain pubspec.yaml file.",
        "answer": "The pubspec.yaml file, also known as 'pubspec', is a file that is included when you create a Flutter project and is located at the top of the project tree. This file contains information about the dependencies like packages and their versions, fonts, etc., that a project requires. It makes sure that the next time you build the project, you will get the same package version. Additionally, you can set constraints for the app. During working with the Flutter project, this configuration file of the project will be required a lot. This specification is written in YAML, which can be read by humans.  \n\nThe following are included in this file:   General project settings, like name of the project, version, description, etc.   \nDependencies within a project.   \nThe assets of the project (e.g., images, audio, etc.).

        "question": "9. What do you understand about tween animation?",
        "answer": "The shortened version of in-between animation is tween animation. The start and endpoints of an animation must be specified in tween animation. Using this method, the animation can begin at the beginning and can progress through a series of values until it reaches the endpoint. Transition speed and duration are also determined by using the tween animation. Calculating the transition from the beginning to the end will be easier with the widget framework. tween animation",

Firebase basically provides a NoSQL database for Flutter apps with the ability to manage data retrieval and storage through JSON protocol. Data sync and quick loading make it one of the most suitable options for Flutter Apps. \nFeatures: Firebase database:  Features: Features NoSQL DB \nAPIs (REST only) \nAuthentication\nAnalytics \nStorage NoSQL DB APIs (REST only) Authentication Analytics Storage SQFlite database: Users can access and modify the SQLite database using this.

        "answer": "The provider is built using widgets. You can use all the objects in the provider as if they were just part of Flutter with the new widget subclasses it creates. This also means that the provider is not cross-platform. The provider is the simplest way to handle state management. Basically, it works on the concept of PUB-SUB i.e., there is one provider and several subscribers.",

We can wrap a widget in a container widget if it needs any styling, like a color, a shape, or a size constraint, etc.\nSizedBox: This is a specific size box. It does not allow us to set the widget's color or decoration, unlike Container. In this case, we only need to resize the widget that is passed as a child.

        "answer": "Null-aware operators in dart allow you to make computations based on whether or not a value is null. Dart provides some useful information to handle the null values. The \"??=\" assignment operator: It assigns a value to a variable only if it is null.

The \"??\" null-aware operator: This one computes and returns the value between two expressions. In the first step, expression 1 is checked for nullness, and if it is, its value is returned; otherwise, expression 2 is evaluated, and its value is returned.

It is possible to use the ?. operator when calling a method/getter on an object, as long as the object isn't null (otherwise, the method will return null).

Conclusion: Flutter is a mobile technology that is among the most innovative and booming in the mobile market as the next revolutionary thing right now. Although it is a relatively new framework for developing cross-platform applications, its popularity is soaring due to which there is an increase in demand for Flutter developers.
