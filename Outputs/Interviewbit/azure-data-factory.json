        "answer": "In today's world, there is an abundance of data coming from a wide range of different sources; collectively, this information forms a gigantic mountain of data. Before we can upload this information to the cloud, there are a few things that need to be taken care of first. As a result of the fact that data can come from a broad number of locations, each of which may employ relatively different protocols for transporting or channelling the information, the data itself can take on a large variety of shapes and sizes. Once this information has been uploaded to the cloud or some other specific storage, it is absolutely necessary for us to manage it in the appropriate manner. That is, you will need to make some adjustments to the statistics and get rid of any unnecessary details. Concerning the transfer of data, it is important for us to collect data from a variety of sources, combine it in a single area for storage, and, if required, change it into a more helpful form. A traditional data warehouse is also capable of achieving this goal, albeit with a few significant limitations. When it comes to integrating all of these sources, there are times when we have no choice but to go ahead and construct bespoke programs that handle each of these procedures on an individual basis. This is not only a time-consuming process but also a significant source of frustration. We need to either find means to automate this process or come up with more effective workflows. data warehouse data warehouse This entire process may be carried out in a manner that is more streamlined, organized, and controllable with the assistance of Data Factory.

        "answer": "The logic that we specify can be used to generate a new column, and this is done by deriving transformations within the mapping data flow. When developing a derived column, we have the option of creating a brand-new one from scratch or making changes to an existing one. You can recognise the new column by giving it a name in the textbox labelled Column. If you choose a different column from the menu, the one you currently have selected will be removed from your schema. Select the textbox that corresponds to the derived column, and then press the Enter key on your keyboard to get started crafting an expression for it. You can either manually enter your reasoning or make use of the expression builder to construct it.",

        "answer": "In the ADF pipeline, the Lookup activity is typically utilized for configuration lookup most of the time due to the ready availability of the source dataset. In addition to this, the output of the activity can be used to retrieve the data from the dataset that served as the source. In most cases, the outcomes of a lookup operation are sent back down the pipeline to be used as input for later phases. In order to retrieve data, the ADF pipeline makes heavy use of lookup operations. You may only utilize it in a manner that is appropriate for the process you are going through. You have the option of retrieving either the first row or all of the rows, depending on the dataset or query you choose.",

        "answer": "Within the context of our ongoing transition from on-premises to cloud storage, the problems of throughput and speed have emerged as important obstacles. When we attempt to replicate the data from on-premises using the Copy activity, we do not achieve the throughput that we require. The configuration variables that are available for a copy activity make it possible to fine-tune the process and achieve the desired results. If we load data from servers located on-premises, we should first compress it using the available compression option before writing it to cloud storage, where the compression will afterwards be erased.\nAfter the compression has been activated, ii) it is imperative that all of our data be quickly sent to the staging area. Before being stored in the target cloud storage buckets, the data that was transferred might be uncompressed for convenience.\nCopying Proportion, The use of parallelism is yet another alternative that offers the potential to make the process of transfer more seamless. This accomplishes the same thing as employing a number of different threads to process the data and can speed up the rate at which data is copied.\nBecause there is no one size those fits all, we will need to try out a variety of different values, such as 8, 16, and 32, to see which one functions the most effective.\nIt may be possible to hasten the duplication process by increasing the Data Integration Unit, which is roughly comparable to the number of central processing units.

        "answer": "Azure Data Factory provides superior tools for transmitting and manipulating data, and these tools can be found in its feature set. However, you should be aware that there are certain limitations as well. Because the data factory does not allow the use of nested looping activities, any pipeline that has such a structure will require a workaround in order to function properly. Here is where we classify everything that has a looping structure: actions involving the conditions if, for, and till respectively.\nThe lookup activity is capable of retrieving a maximum of 5000 rows in a single operation at its maximum capacity. To reiterate, in order to implement this kind of pipeline design, we are going to need to use some additional loop activity in conjunction with SQL with the limit.\nIt is not possible for a pipeline to have more than forty activities in total, and this number includes any inner activities as well as any containers.

        "answer": "As was discussed in the previous section's third question, Data Factory makes it easier to carry out three processes: moving data, transforming data, and exercising control. The operations known as data movement do precisely what their name suggests, which is to say that they facilitate the flow of data from one point to another. For example, information can be moved from one data store to another using Data Factory's Copy Activity. Other data stores may also be used.\n\"Data transformation activities\" are any operations that modify data as it is being loaded into its final destination system. Stored Procedures, U-SQL, Azure Functions, and so on are just a few examples.\nControl (flow) activities, as their name suggests, are designed to help regulate the speed of any process that is going through a pipeline. For example, selecting the Wait action will result in the pipeline pausing for the amount of time that was specified.
