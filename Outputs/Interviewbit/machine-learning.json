        "question": "2. Why was Machine Learning Introduced?",
        "answer": "The simplest answer is to make our lives easier. In the early days of \u201cintelligent\u201d applications, many systems used hardcoded rules of \u201cif\u201d and \u201celse\u201d decisions to process data or adjust the user input. Think of a spam filter whose job is to move the appropriate incoming email messages to a spam folder. But with the machine learning algorithms, we are given ample information for the data to learn and identify the patterns from the data. Unlike the normal problems we don\u2019t need to write the new rules for each problem in machine learning, we just need to use the same workflow but with a different dataset. Let\u2019s talk about Alan Turing, in his 1950 paper, \u201cComputing Machinery and Intelligence\u201d, Alan asked, \u201cCan machines think?\u201d Full paper here here The paper describes the \u201cImitation Game\u201d, which includes three participants - Human acting as a judge,\nAnother human, and\nA computer is an attempt to convince the judge that it is human. Human acting as a judge, Another human, and A computer is an attempt to convince the judge that it is human. The judge asks the other two participants to talk. While they respond the judge needs to decide which response came from the computer. If the judge could not tell the difference the computer won the game. The test continues today as an annual competition in artificial intelligence. The aim is simple enough: convince the judge that they are chatting to a human instead of a computer chatbot program.",

Suppose we have given some data points that each belong to one of two classes, and the goal is to separate two classes based on a set of examples. In SVM, a data point is viewed as a p-dimensional vector (a list of p numbers), and we wanted to know whether we can separate such points with a (p-1)-dimensional hyperplane. This is called a linear classifier. There are many hyperplanes that classify the data. To choose the best hyperplane that represents the largest separation or margin between the two classes. \nIf such a hyperplane exists, it is known as a maximum-margin hyperplane and the linear classifier it defines is known as a maximum margin classifier. The best hyperplane that divides the data in H3  We have data (x1, y1), ..., (xn, yn), and different features (xii, ..., xip), and yiis either 1 or -1. The equation of the hyperplane H3 is the set of points satisfying: w. x-b = 0 Where w is the normal vector of the hyperplane. The parameter b||w||determines the offset of the hyperplane from the original along the normal vector w So for each i, either xiis in the hyperplane of 1 or -1.

Bayes\u2019 theorem states the following relationship, given class variable y and dependent vector x1  through xn: P(yi | x1,..., xn) =P(yi)P(x1,..., xn | yi)(P(x1,..., xn) Using the naive conditional independence assumption that each xiis independent: for all I this relationship is simplified to: P(xi | yi, x1, ..., xi-1, xi+1, ...., xn) = P(xi | yi) Since, P(x1,..., xn) is a constant given the input, we can use the following classification rule: P(yi | x1, ..., xn) = P(y) ni=1P(xi | yi)P(x1,...,xn) and we can also use Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation to estimate P(yi)and P(yi | xi) the former is then the relative frequency of class yin the training set. P(yi | x1,..., xn)  P(yi) ni=1P(xi | yi) y = arg max P(yi)ni=1P(xi | yi) The different naive Bayes classifiers mainly differ by the assumptions they make regarding the distribution of P(yi | xi): can be Bernoulli, binomial, Gaussian, and so on.",
