The process is similar to parallel processing, but it works on a more granular scale. Instead of writing one program, you write multiple programs that can run in parallel. The result is that you can write a new version of the program in just a few hours instead of weeks or months. When you use pipelining, you write multiple versions of your software program at the same time. Each version is tested and developed separately. When all the programs are completed, the final version is run all at once.",

When two stations transmit to each other on the same frequency at the same time, the mode is known as half-duplex (not simultaneous). Half-duplex, however, is commonly known as Simplex (not simultaneous). Sometimes, at high and microwave wireless frequencies, simplex or half-duplex mode will not be adequate for providing enough range for communications. To increase the effectiveness of the range, wireless repeaters are employed. There are several different frequencies that the incoming signal might be than the outgoing signal, thus preventing the transmitted signal from overwhelming the repeater receiver. Repeaters, strategically positioned at significant locations with wide line-of-sight coverage areas, may greatly enhance the range of a wireless communications system.",

        "answer": "The performance of a network is dependent on a number of factors, including the quality of the hardware, the speed of the internet connection, and the amount of traffic that is being transferred. The speed of the internet connection is important because it affects how quickly data can be transferred. A high-speed connection can transfer data at a much higher rate than a low-speed connection. The quality of the hardware also affects the performance of a network. Poorly-made hardware can cause problems with connectivity and performance. Finally, traffic can affect the performance of a network. If too much traffic is being transferred over a network, it can slow down the performance of the network. So, if you want to improve your network's performance, you should make sure that all of your equipment is up to date and that you are using the best possible internet connection.",

        "question": "8. What is LAN in networking?",
        "answer": "Personal computers and workstations may share data, tools, and programs via a local area network. A switch or series of switches interconnects network devices so that computers and workstations may share data, tools, and programs. Private addressing is used in conjunction with the TCP/IP protocol to establish a local area network. A router connects the local area network to the wider internet. The amount of data that can be transmitted at any given moment is limited by the number of computers connected, which means that the hardware (such as hubs, network adapters, and Ethernet cables) must be inexpensive and fast (i.e., hubs, network adapters, and Ethernet cables). Due to their small size, LANs (which are privately owned) cannot be used for much beyond an office building, home, hospital, school, etc. To build and maintain a LAN, twisted-pair cables and coaxial cables are typically used. The distance covered is also limited, so noise and error are minimized. In the early days of LANs, data rates usually ranged from 4 to 16 Mbps. Today, 100 Mbps and 1000 Mbps speeds are more common. Because of the short path between computers in a LAN, the delay is very short. A LAN may be connected with up to thousands of PCs, even if wired connections are the primary means of communication. A LAN may include both wired and wireless connections to provide greater speed and security. A LAN can be more stable and have fewer congestion issues than a typical network. For example, in a single room where several Counter-Strike players are playing (without internet access).  ",

        "answer": "WANs, also known as wide area networks, connect LANs over telephone lines and radio waves to form computer networks that cover a large area, even though they might be confined to a single country or state. Enterprises, governmental agencies, and other organizations may connect to WANs. WANs are fast and costly to operate. WANs are difficult to design and maintain, with switched WAN and point-to-point WAN being the two types. A WAN is less fault-tolerant and has more congestion in the network than a MAN. Telephone lines or satellite links are used for communication. WANs are prone to long-distance noise and errors. WAN data rates are slower than LAN data rates, because of the increased distance and increased number of servers and terminals involved, plus slower speeds. WAN speeds range from Kbps to Mbps, whereas LAN speeds typically range from Mbps to Gigabits per second (Gbps). The biggest obstacle is the propagation delay. Devices are utilised for WAN transmission in addition to Optic wires, microwave emissions, and satellites. Switched WANs include Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks and Point-to-Point WANs, which connect a home computer to the Internet via a telephone line.  ",

It is large in geographic scope and may function as an ISP (internet service provider). MAN connections range from Mbps. It is difficult to establish and maintain a MAN network due to its complexity. MANs are less reliable and more congested. They are costly and may or may not be controlled by a single organisation. Data transfers through MANs are fast but there is a low amount of data. Modems and wire/cable are used for transmission of data. A MAN is a portion of a telephone company network that provides a DSL line to a customer or a city's cable TV network.  ",

        "question": "15. What is Firewalls in networking?",
        "answer": "A firewall monitors all incoming and outgoing traffic and matches a set of security rules to determine whether to accept, reject, or drop a packet. When a rule is matched, an action is performed on the network traffic. For example, a firewall table might match network traffic against a rule specifying that employees from the HR department are forbidden from accessing data from a code server, and another rule may specify that system administrators are permitted to access both HR and technical data. A firewall can be designed to suit the organisation's security and efficiency needs by combining rules. A firewall operates in two phases. It blocks both outgoing and incoming network connections. On the one hand, a firewall allows outgoing connections from a server. In this case, outgoing connections are permitted from a firewall's perspective. On the other hand, it is always best to set a firewall rule to block outgoing connections. This is because doing so will improve security and prevent unwanted communication. As mentioned above, ICMP messages are the most common type of incoming traffic. They have a source IP address and a destination IP address. Port numbers are also included in TCP and UDP communications. In the case of incoming ICMP packets, the type of message is used as opposed to a port number.  ",

        "answer": "Mobile security protects the infrastructure, software, and strategy behind mobile devices that travel with users. Mobile devices, including smartphones, tablets, and laptops, must be protected from cyberattacks. Mobile devices are becoming more popular than their stationary counterparts, so they are becoming bigger targets for hackers. As more workers and consumers use mobile devices for internet browsing, mobile devices have become an integral part of their daily lives. Mobile devices have evolved from desktop-only internet browsers to being the preferred method of browsing the internet. Laptop-toting travellers are now the exception rather than the norm. Browsing on mobile devices has become the primary form of internet usage, and mobile web traffic has overtaken desktop internet usage. Mobile devices pose a greater danger to corporate security than stationary computers do. Mobile devices are more vulnerable than stationary computers to both physical and virtual attacks. Since mobile devices are mobile and can be used anywhere, they are more susceptible to theft and loss than stationary devices. Besides the physical and virtual threats posed by third-party applications and Wi-Fi hotspots, administrators must be on the lookout for the possibility of man-in-the-middle attacks. With mobile devices, users can root them, install any app, and lose them physically.

Network data protection standards SSL (secure sockets layer) and Layer 2 VPN (virtue layer VPN) have become common worldwide thanks to their recognisable sign. They are utilised by many businesses that desire to ensure their safety and security as well as their internal networks, backbone networks, and virtual private networks (VPNs). Network-level data encryption is a fairly blunt weapon at the low level. Information flowing over the network is almost completely oblivious to the value of the data, and this context is almost always set to protect everything. Even when the \u201cprotect everything\u201d strategy is used, network traffic patterns can provide valuable information to potential attackers. Network data encryption is only part of a complete data security strategy.

        "answer": "A VPN service can increase your online security, anonymity, and freedom, all without having to sacrifice any of them. It's a straightforward and quick method of doing so. When using the internet, your device constantly sends data to other sites in order to exchange information. A VPN creates a secure tunnel between your device (e.g. mobile or laptop) and the web. Using a VPN, you may send data across a secure, encrypted connection to an external server: the VPN server. From there, your information will be delivered to its destination on the web. Securing your data and hiding your online identity are just a few of the advantages of rerouting your internet traffic through a VPN server.",

        "question": "16. What is traceroute?",
        "answer": "By using tools for network diagnostics, known as traceroute, administrators can trace the path data packets take from their source to their destination, thus finding connectivity problems. On a Windows machine, tracert is the command; on Linux and Mac, it is traceroute. Traceroute and tracert both function similarly; they trace the route data takes from one location in a network to a specific IP server. Traceroute records the name and IP address of each intermediate device that a data packet must traverse in order to reach its destination. It then provides the round-trip time (RTT) and the device name. You can use traceroute to determine where a problem is occurring, but it alone can't tell you if there is one. To help you determine if there is a problem, ping can be used. Imagine that you're trying to visit a website and pages take a long time to load. If you use traceroute to determine where the longest delays are occurring, you can determine where the problem is.",

        "question": "17. What is Port Scanning?",
        "answer": "A port scan is a method for discovering which ports are open on a machine or network. To test whether someone is at home before knocking on the door, you could port scan the system or network. It reveals which ports are open and accepting information, as well as shows if firewalls are installed between the source and target. Fingerprinting is the term used to describe this technique. As a result, it can also be an ideal reconnaissance tool for attackers seeking to discover a network\u2019s weakest point of entry. It is also used to test network security and the firewall's strength. Port scanning is a standard technique employed by hackers to discover open doors or weak spots in a network. A port scan attack may help cyber criminals discover available ports and determine whether they are sending or receiving data. It may also reveal whether security systems like firewalls are being used by a company. When hackers contact a port, the response they receive determines whether the port is being used and whether potential vulnerabilities exist. A business may also scan ports using this technique and analyze the response for potential vulnerabilities. They may then employ tools like IP scanner, network scanner (Nmap), and Netcat to ensure the security of their network and systems.",

        "question": "18. What is port blocking within LAN?",
        "answer": "An Internet Service Provider (ISP) blocks Internet traffic by using the port number and transfer protocol. Blocking certain types of ports within a local area network is known as port blocking. Blocking ports on plug-and-play devices such as USB flash drives, removable devices, CD/DVD/CD-ROM, floppy, and mobile devices like smartphones is among the reasons for port blocking. Suppose your network has DHCP service enabled. When a user connects their laptop to your device, they can obtain your IP address from the DHCP and gain access to your network resources. This is why you should turn on port security if you can to prevent ports from conflicting with MAC addresses and allowing anonymous users to obtain an IP address.",

        "question": "19. What is a Botnet?",
        "answer": "A botnet is a group of computers that has been taken over by a bot, or a robot-controlled computer network. Multi-layered computer schemes are often used to infiltrate and assemble a botnet. Massive data theft, server crashes, and malware distribution are just a few of the automated tasks that bots are capable of completing. A botnet is a group of infected devices used to scam other users or cause disruptions without the victims\u2019 consent. The \u201cwhat is a botnet attack and how does it work?\u201d query is appropriate here. To assist you in understanding how botnets are created and employed, we'll demonstrate how they're made.",

        "question": "20. What is secure remote access?",
        "answer": "A secure remote access process or solution may include security procedures such as VPN, multifactor authentication, and endpoint protection, among others. It is designed to keep crooks away from an organisation's digital assets and safeguard sensitive information. Remote access may be protected via VPN, multifactor authentication, or endpoint protection. Today's IT environment, which is facing a rapidly changing threat landscape and the growing number of remote workers as a result of the Covid pandemic, demands secure remote access. In order to succeed, users must be educated, strong cybersecurity policies must be implemented, and best security hygiene practices must be developed. Conclusion Network security is the protection of information and data in a network. It is the protection of data that is stored on a computer or network server from unauthorized access, modification, or theft. Network security is an important part of protecting your organization's data and systems. It can help to prevent cyber attacks and protect critical infrastructure from damage. In order to be successful in a security interview, you need to have a solid understanding of the basics of security. This includes understanding the basic concepts and principles of security, including how to secure your network and how to protect your data. You also need to know what types of threats you face, how you can detect and prevent them, and how you can protect yourself from them. In addition, you should also understand what types of vulnerabilities are present in your system and how they can be exploited. For example, if you have a lot of sensitive data stored on your computer or network, this might make it easier for hackers to gain access to your system. In this case, it is important that you understand the risks and benefits of different types of systems. Finally, it is important that you know how to perform various tasks on your system and how they can be performed safely. This includes setting up network settings (for example, firewall rules), configuring services (for example, web browser or file transfer programs), managing devices (for example, computers or printers), and managing user accounts (for example, logging into social media accounts).
