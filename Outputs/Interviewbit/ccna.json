        "question": "13. Write the main function of the application layer in networking?",
        "answer": "The application layer is the topmost layer in the OSI model that is used by end-user software such as web browsers and email clients. It is considered as the layer through which users interact. It usually consists of some protocols that are more focused on process-to-process communication across an IP Network. Some of its functions include: Manage data exchange in a peer-to-peer or a client-server networking model.  \nProvide firm communication interface and end-user services. \nEnables users to access the network. \nProvide the basis for email forwarding and storage facilities. \nAllows access to global information about different services.

        "answer": "OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is basically a popular link-state routing protocol for IP networks that are used to connect to a large number of networks without any limitation on the number of hops. It determines the best route for delivering the data packets within an IP network.  It has been implemented by a wide range of network vendors such as Cisco. It works on Dijkstra Algorithm. OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) Firstly, a shortest-path tree is constructed. \nSecondly, the routing table is populated with the resulting best paths. Firstly, a shortest-path tree is constructed.
