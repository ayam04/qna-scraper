        "answer": "A bug report is a detailed report which explains what is incorrect and needs to be fixed in software or on a website. The report includes a request and/or details for how to address each issue, as well as a list of causes or noticed faults to point out exactly what is perceived as wrong. Bug reports are a technique to inform developers about parts of their code that aren't behaving as expected or designed, allowing them to see which parts of their software need to be improved. This can be a difficult effort for the developer, and without enough information, it is nearly impossible. Fortunately, testers may make this process considerably easier by producing high-quality bug reports that include all of the information a developer might need to locate the problem.  ",

        "question": "10. What do you understand about ad-hoc testing?",
        "answer": "Ad hoc testing is a type of unstructured or informal software testing that seeks to interrupt the testing process in order to uncover potential defects or errors as soon as feasible. Ad hoc testing is a type of testing that is done at random and is usually an unplanned activity that does not use any documentation or test design methodologies to construct test cases.   Ad-hoc testing is done on any portion of the application at random and does not follow any standardized testing procedures. The primary goal of this testing is to detect problems through random inspection. Error Guessing, a software testing approach, can be used to perform ad hoc testing. People with adequate familiarity with the system can \"predict\" the most likely source of errors, which is known as error guessing. This testing does not necessitate any paperwork, planning, or procedure. Because this testing seeks to detect faults through a random technique, defects will not be mapped to test cases if there is no documentation. This means that reproducing errors can be difficult at times because there are no test processes or requirements associated with them.",

        "question": "1. What do you understand about Risk based testing?",
        "answer": "Risk-based testing (RBT) is a method of software testing that is based on risk likelihood. It entails analyzing the risk based on software complexity, business criticality, frequency of use, and probable Defect areas, among other factors. Risk-based testing prioritizes testing of software programme aspects and functions that are more important and likely to have flaws. Risk-based testing Risk is the occurrence of an unknown event that has a positive or negative impact on a project's measured success criteria. It could be something that happened in the past, something that is happening now, or something that will happen in the future. These unforeseen events might have an impact on a project's cost, business, technical, and quality goals. Risks can be positive or negative. Positive risks are referred to as opportunities, and they aid in the long-term viability of a corporation. Investing in a new project, changing corporate processes, and developing new products are just a few examples. Negative risks are also known as threats, and strategies to reduce or eliminate them are necessary for project success.",

        "answer": "Fuzz Testing is a software testing technique that utilizes erroneous, unexpected, or random data as input and then looks for exceptions like crashes and memory leaks. It's a type of automated testing that's used to define system testing techniques that use a randomized or dispersed approach. During fuzz testing, a system or software program may have a variety of data input problems or glitches. Fuzz Testing Following are the different phases of Fuzz Testing:   Identify the Target System: The system or software application that will be tested is identified. The target system is the name given to that system. The testing team determines the target system.\nIdentify Inputs: Once the target system is determined, random inputs are generated for testing purposes. The system or software application is tested using these random test scenarios as inputs.\nGenerate Fuzzed Data: After receiving unexpected and invalid inputs, these invalid and unexpected inputs are turned to fuzzed data. Fuzzed data is essentially random data that has been transformed into fuzzy logic.\nUse fuzzed data to run the test: The fuzzed data testing process is now being used. Basically, the code of the programme or software is executed in this portion by providing random input, i.e. fuzzed data.\nMonitor System Behavior: After the system or software application has completed its execution, check for any crashes or other anomalies, such as potential memory leaks. The random input is used to test the system's behaviour.\nLog Flaws: In the final phase, defects are detected and rectified in order to produce a higher-quality system or software program.

        "answer": "Equivalence Class Partitioning (ECP) is another name for the Equivalence Partitioning Method. It is a software testing technique, often known as black-box testing, that splits the input domain into data classes from which test cases can be constructed. An ideal test case identifies a type of error that may necessitate the execution of a large number of arbitrary test cases before a general error is detected. Equivalence classes are evaluated for given input conditions in equivalence partitioning. When any input is given, the type of input condition is examined, and the Equivalence class defines or explains a collection of valid or invalid states for this input condition. Equivalence Class Partitioning Example 1 - Let's take a look at a typical college admissions procedure. There is a college that admits students depending on their grade point average. Consider a percentage field that will only accept percentages between 50 and 90%; anything higher or lower will result in the program redirecting the visitor to an error page. If the user enters a percentage that is less than 50% or greater than 90%, the equivalence partitioning technique will display an invalid percentage. The equivalence partitioning method will show a valid percentage if the percentage entered is between 50 and 90%. Example 1 - Let's take a look at a typical college admissions procedure.

There is a triplet (5, 3 and 1) present in the array whose sum is 9. Approach: Approach: The algorithm's performance can be increased by sorting the array. The two-pointer technique is used in this effective method. Fix the first element of the triplet by traversing the array.

        "question": "5. Swap the values of two variables, x and y, without needing a third variable.",
        "answer": "Approach 1: Approach 1: Approach 1: The goal is to find a sum in one of the two numbers provided. The total and subtraction from the sum can then be used to swap the integers. Code: Code: #include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main()\n{\n   int a = 1, b = 2;\n\n   cout << \"Before Swapping : a = \" << a << \" and b = \" << b << \"\\n\";\n   a = a + b; // storing the sum of a and b in a\n   b = a - b; // storing the value of the original a in b\n   a = a - b; // storing the value of the original b in a\n   cout << \"After Swapping : a = \" << a << \" and b = \" << b << \"\\n\";\n} #include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main()\n{\n   int a = 1, b = 2;\n\n   cout << \"Before Swapping : a = \" << a << \" and b = \" << b << \"\\n\";\n   a = a + b; // storing the sum of a and b in a\n   b = a - b; // storing the value of the original a in b\n   a = a - b; // storing the value of the original b in a\n   cout << \"After Swapping : a = \" << a << \" and b = \" << b << \"\\n\";\n} #include <bits/stdc++.h> include <bits/stdc++.h> using namespace int main() int main () int 1 2 \"Before Swapping : a = \" \" and b = \" \"\\n\" // storing the sum of a and b in a // storing the value of the original a in b // storing the value of the original b in a \"After Swapping : a = \" \" and b = \" \"\\n\" Output : Output : Before Swapping : a = 1 and b = 2\nAfter Swapping : a = 2 and b = 1 Before Swapping : a = 1 and b = 2\nAfter Swapping : a = 2 and b = 1 1 and 2 2 and 1 Explanation :\nIn the above code, we first stored the sum of both the numbers in the first variable. Then, we store the original value of the first variable in the second variable by subtracting the second variable from the sum. Similarly we change the value for the second variable as well. Thus, we swapped the two numbers without using a third variable. Explanation :  Approach 2 : Approach 2 : Approach 2 : To swap two variables, use the bitwise XOR operator. When two integers x and y are XORed, the result is a number with all bits set to 1 wherever the bits of x and y differ. For instance, the XOR of 10 (in Binary 1010) and 5 (in Binary 0101) is 1111, while the XOR of 7 (0111) and 5 (0101) is 1111. (0010). We can then xor the resultant XORed with the other number to swap the values. Considering the above example, when we xor 1111 with 0101 we get 1010.
