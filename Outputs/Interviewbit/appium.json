        "question": "1. Explain the JSON Wire protocol used by Appium.",
        "answer": "The JSON Wire Protocol is the method by which client and server data are exchanged. It was created by WebDriver's developers. The protocol, according to them, consists of a set of standardised endpoints that are offered to clients via a RESTful API. This enables the webdriver to communicate with a server and a client in order to automate tasks. In this protocol, JSON is used to transmit data between the server and the client. Before delivering an object to a server, a client (or the computer running the WebDriver API) turns it into a JSON object. The JSON object is parsed by the server and converted back to a JavaScript object. The response object is converted to a JSON string by the server and returned to the client. For use, the client transforms the JSON string to a JavaScript object.   In the above image, we can see the client and the server communicates with each other via JSON wire protocol. The server sends a request to the appium server for running tests and the appium server sends back the response to the main server. The mobile JSON Wire Protocol, which is an extension of the Selenium JSON Wire Protocol, is used by Appium. Other than establishing up a communication stream, it's used to regulate other mobile phone behaviours.",

Because it is a \"cross-platform\" tool, a method must be in place to distinguish between the session requests of the two operating systems. JSON objects, referred to as Desired Capabilities, were introduced to address this specific problem statement.   Desired Capabilities are key-value pairs of data that separate the establishment of an Android app testing session from that of an iOS app testing session.

        "answer": "Appium session is a medium to send commands to a specific test application. Commands are always executed within the context of a session. Before performing any command, a client utilizes the session identifier as the sessionId parameter. A session is requested by the client library from the server. After that, the server will return a sessionId endpoint, which can be used to submit additional commands to interact with the application(s) being tested. Every 'testing' is included within a session. Given that Appium is a simple client and server-based method, this is self-evident. Post requests, also known as session requests, are sent by the client to the server. These queries use the JSON Wire Protocol to communicate and convey information in JSON Object format.",

        "answer": "End-to-end mobile application test automation is a method of testing a software product from beginning to end to ensure that the application flow is as planned. It establishes the product's system mandates and ensures that all integrated components perform as expected.   The goal of end-to-end (E2E) mobile application test automation is to test from the perspective of the end-user by replicating a real-world situation, in which a user uses the application, and confirming the system under test and its components for data integrity and integration. These days, software systems are sophisticated and integrated with numerous subsystems. The entire software system could fail if one of the subsystem fails. We employ end-to-end mobile application test automation to eliminate this big risk. Following things should be kept in mind while performing end-to-end mobile testing automation : The installation of the application\nLaunching the application for the first time without having network access.\nThe uninstallation of the application.\nIf the application is supported in horizontal mode, the orientation of the application.\nTesting the performance of an application on a variety of devices and network conditions.\nTesting the application's response and how it reacts when a user credential is provided that is invalid.

The test scripts are written by the tester and run on the device or emulator. Appium creates and manages many webdriver sessions for various platforms such as Android and iOS.   Test scripts produced by the tester are sent to the Appium server as requests, which are then executed on the emulator or device. Each vendor has its own technique and methodology for executing test cases on the device, such as IOS or Android. As a result, the test case runs after the Appium server receives commands. To transmit command requests to the Appium server, Appium uses JSON (Javascript Object Notation) wire protocol. Here, JSON is used to transmit data between the server and the client.",

Appium comes in helpful when it comes to testing scenarios that users will encounter when using your app. Appium, on the other hand, becomes a restriction if you need to test more than UX simple interactions. Consider features such as keyboarding. When sophisticated touch/keyboard mixed circumstances are involved, the likelihood of a false failure is significant. Exchanging data is another minor pain with Appium. You'll need to use various strategies when your test needs to exchange data with your app. So keep in mind that sending and receiving information isn't always simple.

During this test, participants are given particular, realistic circumstances to use the application in. On the basis of gathering direct input from the end-user, usability testing is also reliable.\nAs a result, the testing procedure is free of prejudice while simultaneously guaranteeing that highlighted areas improve. Usability testing also ensures that the design is intuitive and prioritises usability and customer experience.\nPerformance Testing: Performance testing is a critical subset of mobile application testing that examines an application's performance, stability, and responsiveness under various workload situations. A performance test's main goal is to ensure that an application is completely aligned with the performance objectives. \nAdditionally, it addresses performance constraints prior to launching an application. Bottlenecks are processes inside a system's overall functions that cause the system's overall performance to slow or stall. Load testing, volume testing, soak testing, spike testing, and stress testing are all popular forms of performance assessments.\nSecurity Testing: In today's world, security is a major worry for practically every mobile application developer. According to reports, 80% of users are more likely to delete an application because of security concerns. As a result, it is critical to concentrate on mobile application security testing.\nUsers' personal information is required by certain programs, such as travel applications, for various transactions. If your application requires something similar, it's critical that you provide assurances about the application's confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. You should have strong tests run on your application that assure that no one can break into someone else's account by unfair means.\nInterruption Testing: Interruption testing is important for determining how an application behaves when it is interrupted before returning to its former state. Incoming phone calls or SMS, alarms, push notifications from mobile applications, battery low or full, network connection loss and recovery, and plugged in or out while charging are all examples of interruptions. In the event of an interruption, an application should normally run in the background and return to its prior state.\nManual Testing: Manual testing is a tried and true method for thoroughly traversing the complexity of mobile application testing. Manual testing ensures that the finished product performs optimally in accordance with the planned expectations. It's especially useful in situations where the use case isn't immediately evident. Professional QA testers could work in short bursts to assess an application and ensure that it produces accurate results.\nCompatibility Testing: Compatibility testing is one of the most important types of mobile application testing. It's a form of non-functional testing that ensures a mobile application's functionality across a variety of operating systems, applications, devices, internal hardware specs, and network conditions. Compatibility testing determines whether a mobile application is compatible with various operating systems and versions.\nIt also tests a mobile application's compatibility with various devices, browsers, networks, and other characteristics. Backward compatibility testing and forward compatibility testing are the two types of compatibility testing.\nLocalisation Testing: Localization testing is a must for mobile applications that are targeted at a certain geographic location. It's crucial to test the mobile application's responsiveness to the region's distinct language and cultural aspects. Local currency, use of suitable time zone date and time formats, numerous local legislation needs, and the text and user interface are only a few of the important areas that localization testing evaluates.\nFunctional Testing: Functional mobile application testing ensures that the application's functionalities meet the specified requirements. This form of testing focuses mostly on the mobile application's main goal and flow. Functionality testing determines if an application can properly launch and install. It also tests the simplicity of sign-up and login, as well as the presentation of push notifications and the proper operation of text boxes and buttons.\nInstallation Testing: Installation testing, also known as implementation testing, is a good way to ensure that a mobile application is installed and removed correctly. Furthermore, installation testing is necessary to ensure that updates are seamless and error-free. Installation testing also examines what happens if users fail to update a mobile application.\nAutomated Testing: Certain mobile application quality assessments are overly complicated and time-consuming. In such instances, Mobile application Test Automation Services come into play, providing optimally prepared and effectively conducted automated testing as well as manual testing, which can aid in assuring quality while also allowing for the speedier release of superior goods.

        "answer": "  Simulator: A simulator is used to simulate an environment with all of the software variables and configurations that will be present in the actual production environment of an application. Simulators do not try to replicate the actual hardware that will run the application in production. Simulators can be written in high-level programming languages because they merely construct software environments. For example, a car racing game application can be thought of as a simulator as it simulates a real car race. Simulator: Emulator: An emulator does try to replicate all of the hardware and software aspects of a real-world environment. In most cases, you'll need to develop an emulator in assembly language to accomplish this. Emulators might thus be thought of as occupying a midway ground between simulators and real-world gadgets. For example, a car simulator racing game can be thought of as an emulator. It provides the hardware aspects of car racing as well with the help of emulators. Emulator: Emulators replicate both hardware and software features, whereas simulators solely simulate environment features that may be adjusted or created using the software. Emulators aren't a replacement for real-device testing since they don't always do a good job of simulating the hardware and software of a production system. They simply allow you to create an environment that is more similar to that of a real device.\nEmulators are somewhat slower as compared to simulators as emulators need to sense the movement of hardware devices, convert it into a digital signal, and then process them.

Following are the disadvantages of Appium:- disadvantages There is no support for generating detailed reports of the tests executed.\nThe tests are a little slow because they rely on the remote web driver.\nThe fact that Appium uses UIAutomator for Android, which only supports Android SDK, API 16, or higher, is not a limitation, but rather an overhead. Appium, on the other hand, does not natively support earlier APIs. To support older APIs, it makes use of an open-source library called Selendroid.\nOn a Mac OS device, only one iOS Script can run at a time, which implies only one test can be run at a time. We will need the same number of Mac machines if we wish to run our tests on numerous iOS devices at the same time. Organizing many Mac machines, on the other hand, would be costly.

        "answer": "No, automation testing cannot be a complete replacement for manual software testing. This is because the tools used are meant to execute tests once they are set up and proper automation requires as little human participation as feasible. As convenient as it is, it should not be used to replace manual testing; rather, it should be used for repetitive activities such as load testing, which requires thousands of virtual users. Engineers should not automate test scripts if they are only intended to run on a periodic basis, nor should they automate code reviews or bug testing for new software builds that may require human engagement to detect errors. To sum up, we can say that large-scale, repetitive jobs are better suited to automation.",

It accepts commands and connection requests from the client and executes them on iOS or Android devices. It responds to HTTP requests with HTTP responses. It runs the user interface of the app using a mobile test automation framework to perform requests. As an example - UIAutomator is used for Android API 16 or higher, while Selendroid is used for Android API 15 or below. Apple Instruments is used for iOS. Working of Appium on Android: Working of Appium on Android: Appium sends the command to a UIAutomator script running on the device on Android. UIAutomator is an Android native UI automation framework that allows you to run Junit test cases straight from the command line on the device. Despite the fact that it is written in Java, Appium can be run from any WebDriver enabled language. Android makes use of bootstrap.jar, a TCP server. It's used to deliver test commands to an Android device, which UIAutomator then executes.   In the above image, we can clearly see the architecture of Appium used for running on Android devices. Working of Appium on iOS: Working of Appium on iOS: As Android uses UIAutomator, iOS uses UIAutomation. Similar to the Android, Appium proxies the command to a UIAutomation test case running on the Mac instruments environment. Apple provides this application \"instrument\" that performs various activities like building, profiling, and controlling iOS apps. On the other hand, it also has an automation component where you can write commands in JavaScript. It uses UIAutomation API to interact with Application UI.
