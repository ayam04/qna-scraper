If the switch is set to the \"S\" position, the material master standard price will be used to determine how much stock to add or subtract from the inventory. Any inconsistencies in transactions that can be attributed to price disparities are documented in the account that is named after the price difference. If the price control indication is set to V, you will be charged the GR price for any goods that are received. The material master's weighted moving average price will be updated using a method known as a weighted average, which will be revised. When products are moved or invoices are received at prices that depart from the moving average, any price disparities that exist are credited to the stock account. This happens when the stock account is credited with any price discrepancies that arise.",
