        "question": "1. Explain BDP (Branch distribution points).",
        "answer": "The branch distribution points cannot operate if they can't download content from the standard distribution point. Branch distribution points are instructed to download packages that have been assigned using client policies, then they download the content using standard client components. If the standard distribution point is configured as a protected site system, make sure the branch distribution point is included within the protected boundaries. As long as the computer running the branch distribution point is not included in the protected boundary of the standard distribution point, BDP cannot install the packages it needs. As an example, here is a layout for a branch distribution point:   Having multiple BDPs at the same location will help distribute requests from clients to download package source files. As long as all these branch distribution points have the same protected boundaries, they effectively work together as a group or unit.",

        "question": "2. What are the essential SCCM features?",
        "answer": "Following are some of the major features offered by System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM):   Operation System Deployment: SCCM provides an organization with all the tools it needs to deploy an operating system to client computers in a network - either via an image installation or via a scripted installation.\nPatching & Updating of OS: After installing the operating system successfully, SCCM starts patching and updating the systems. WSUS is used in most organizations to patch and update servers. SCCM, however, leverages WSUS' advantages and provides IT, administrators, with active patching in addition to WSUS.\nAsset Tracking: Following the installation of a required operating system and any subsequent updates or patches, such systems must be kept up to date with further timely updates or patches. With SCCM, you can keep track of the hardware and software assets of the system.\nRemote Control: Whenever a user or system encounters an issue requiring further assistance from an IT administrator, they can remotely access the system to assess the issue. Using SCCM's remote-control feature, IT administrators and support engineers can access the system remotely.\nReporting: SCCM comes with a report generation tool that can generate reports based on the criteria outlined by the IT administrators. There are different types of reports based on what is required, such as reports of missing patches or updates, reports of standard configurations, inventory reports, etc.\nInternet Client: SCCM is a truly powerful tool that enables remote access to devices like mobile devices or remote systems without necessarily bringing them into the VPN network. Now, this can be done via an Internet client and an installed PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) certificate. These prerequisites will enable SCCM to automatically connect to that system anywhere in the world to inventory, patch, update, and monitor it.\nDesired Configuration Management (DCM): It is the feature that complies with the IT guidelines laid down by an organization, and the standard configuration of a system cannot be modified/altered. With DCM, you can ensure that your managed systems are compliant with key configuration settings that are important to your organization. It ensures that all systems have the same software setup, drivers, updates, and configuration settings.

        "answer": "The SCCM Architecture describes the functionalities and how it can run on different operating systems. Here is a diagram showing the SCCM architecture:   Following are the key components of SCCM system configuration: CAS (Central Administration Site): A CAS or central site is the primary site of SCCM and is located at the top of the configuration manager hierarchy. Additionally, it is referred to as the top-level site in the order. Besides providing a central point of administration, it allows you to manage devices that are distributed throughout a global network. In CAS, only primary sites are supported as child sites, and a single CAS can support 25 child primary sites so as to extend the scale of your hierarchy. This configuration is necessary because a CAS cannot manage devices directly, which is what primary sites do. CAS is used primarily for reporting and administration purposes.\nPrimary site: The site is used to manage devices directly as well as manage bandwidth when your managed devices are distributed across different locations. Almost every client is connected to the primary site. Here, it should be noted that a primary site can only support child secondary sites. Each primary site is capable of supporting up to 250 secondary sites and the hierarchy of more than 100,000 clients.\nSecondary site: Secondary sites should be installed as child sites beneath primary sites. It is used to deliver management capabilities to devices in locations that do not have a reliable connection to a primary site. Despite the fact that a secondary site generally extends the primary site, it is still the primary site that manages all clients. In order to manage secondary sites, primary site servers are used. Each secondary site has its own SQL database server (SQL Express) that helps establish the connection between clients and primary site servers. Secondary site servers support 5,000 client hierarchies, and they also deploy SCCM clients.\nDistribution point: The distribution point helps the client systems obtain the content (files) necessary for installations (Packages, Applications, OS, Driver Packages, etc.). This can be either a local or remote distribution point. Distribution points can support up to 4,000 clients, and by default, primary sites and secondary sites are also distribution points.

        "answer": "Communication between Configuration Manager sites must happen through one or more senders, and these senders can only be installed or deployed on primary or secondary site server systems. Instead of providing connectivity to sites, senders use existing network connections for managing connectivity, ensuring the integrity of transferred data, recovering from errors, and closing connections when they are no longer required. SCCM has the following types of senders: Standard Sender: By default, all primary and secondary sites are configured with the standard sender. In the case of site-to-site communications over a LAN (Local Area Network) that uses a supported protocol, you do not have to install an additional sender. \nCourier Sender: Primary and secondary sites are all configured with the courier sender by default. However, it cannot be created or displayed in the Configuration Manager console. The reason for this is that you need to start it manually from the Configuration Manager programs folder on your Start menu. As opposed to sending data over the network, courier senders are essentially used for software distribution in order to send package data via physical media to another site.

The reason for this is that you need to start it manually from the Configuration Manager programs folder on your Start menu. As opposed to sending data over the network, courier senders are essentially used for software distribution in order to send package data via physical media to another site. Courier Sender:",

        "answer": "SUP (Software Update Points) are essentially system roles that are installed on WSUS (Windows Server Update Service) servers and allow you to create packages of software updates based on various criteria. Also, SCCM allows you to create lists of devices that need to be updated as well as set up maintenance windows with a start date and end time, as well as a recurrence pattern. As soon as a package is created, it is distributed to one or more distribution points. Based on ADRs (Automated Deployment Rules), SCCM's powerful scheduler can automatically deploy updates to target clients. The Software Update Point (SUP) illustrates how Windows Update works from an SCCM client's perspective.",

        "question": "11. Explain why to use BITS (Background Intelligent Transfer Service) in SCCM.",
        "answer": "Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) is extensively used by SCCM to transfer or migrate data between client machines and the SCCM servers. It also affects client downloading policies. When you initiate a client push, BITS is used to download the client to the machine. In order to transfer data, BITS utilizes idle bandwidth. BITS transfers data in the background, that is, BITS transfers data only when there is available bandwidth that other applications aren't using.",
