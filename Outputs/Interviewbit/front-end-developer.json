ClickJacking is also regarded as the user interface redressing. It lets the user think that they are utilising a normal UI in the web page, but in actuality, there is an unseen UI in control; you can think of it as the user interface being redressed. When users click on one thing, assuming it to be secure and safe, the hidden UI executes another action.",

Render tree is the graphical depiction of the HTML, with the corresponding CSS. This tree enables painting the contents in their right order. Every node in the Render Tree is regarded as a renderer. The Render tree looks like this:\nLayout: When the renderer is developed and incorporated into the tree, it does not have a size or position. Computing these values is defined as layout. We use the coordinates system to position the element, such as the position of the root renderer is 0,0. The layout continues recursively via a part of the entire renderer hierarchy, calculating geometric info for every renderer that needs it.

It is the building block of websites and is utilized to define and mark content, so a browser shows it correctly. For instance, on a blog post, an image can be seen as an <img> in HTML code, so browsers will understand that they have to display an image.\nCSS: CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is accountable for the style of your web pages such as animations., colours, and layouts. CSS appears more like a group of instructions that gives structure and style to a webpage than a programming language. It enables programmers to control a web application or website's layout, formatting, and presentation. While HTML depicts elements on a page, CSS is accountable for how users see the content. For instance, it handles the border, alignment, size, of an image in a blog post.\nJavaScript: JavaScript is one of three main elements, in front-end web development, that is required to end up with a web page that can be rendered accurately. It is now challenging to visualize websites without JavaScript as it allows programmers to make the sites interactive. This programming language can transform website content on the basis of a user\u2019s action. For instance, at the top of the page, when you click on the Menu button, it will display a dropdown list of options or when you click on a button, it will toggle back and forth between closing and opening the Menu. JavaScript is great at figuring out the kind of browser being utilised, and then rendering the page in such a way that it is not only compatible with that page, but that it works the way it is designed. Using plugins is made easier by JavaScript. When complicated dynamic interactions are required for a site, JavaScript can be implemented to design its framework instead of simply depending only on HTML.\nCSS Frameworks, Libraries, and Preprocessors: Once you understand the fundamentals of CSS, then you can begin to work with various libraries and frameworks. These tools were designed as a way to help hasten the development process. Frameworks like Tailwind CSS, and Bootstrap let you incorporate the catalogue of classes into your webpage. Hence, you end up with mobile-friendly and professional designs. There are ample choices on the market and you don't require to know them all. It's often useful to look at related jobs and check what technologies they're employing.

Debugging is the act of recognizing those bugs and resolving them. Another essential skill to know is debugging. Documenting tests for your code is a way to assure that your code is accomplishing what it is meant to do.\nVersion control: The way of tracking and the modifications to the project's code is version control. Git is regarded as a popular software that is utilized to track your code. If your code gets messed up, you can utilize Git to go back to an earlier version of your code rather than manually rewriting everything.
