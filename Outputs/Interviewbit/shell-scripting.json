        "answer": "A Shell is basically a command-line interpreter between user and kernel or a complete environment specially designed to run commands, shell scripts, and programs. In this, whenever a user enters human-readable commands (input commands) through the keyboard, the shell communicates with the kernel to execute these commands, and display output in a shell script. Just as there are different flavors of operating systems, there are also different types of shells. Every shell has its own set of commands and functions. Shells issue the prompt, $, called a command prompt. You can type into the prompt while it is displayed. After you press enter, your input is read by the shell. Based on the first word of your input, it determines the command you want to run. The characters in a word are separated using spaces and tabs. Example: Example: Here is an example of a date command that displays the current date and time: $date Tue Aug 10 06:03:35 MST 2021 $date Tue Aug 10 06:03:35 MST 2021  ",

It would be impossible to tell where one piece of data stops and the next begins without a file system. There are four blocks in a file system: Super Block: A superblock contains information about a file system, including block size, group size, usage statistics, empty/filled blocks, inode table size & location, and so on. One of the tools used to describe a file system, along with inodes, entries, and files, is the superblock. Multiple superblocks are created with the file system, as the superblock contains critical information.  \nBoot Block: Located on the disk label, a boot block is a special set of blocks that contains data or information on the disk layout. Normally, this block contains the bootstrap loader program, which a user runs upon launching the host computer. The boot block remains blank if the file system is not used for boot.    \nData Block: Also called storage blocks, data blocks contain the remainder of the space allocated to the file system. The data block's size is measured at the time of file system creation. For a regular file, the content of files is contained in the data blocks. For directories, the inode number and file name of the files are contained in the data blocks.  \nInode: Inodes contain information about each file in the filesystem. Normally, an inode doesn't contain a file's name, which is located in a directory instead.  An inode contains information such as the type of file, the permission bits, the owner, the group, the file size, and the time when the file was modified.

In other words, it is the list of commands that you wish to run on a regular schedule and the command that will let you manage it. It is possible to view or edit the table of commands using the crontab command. In addition to the schedule, the term \"Crontab\" also refers to the name of the program used to edit the schedule.",

Together, these access control files perform the following functions: cron.deny cron.allow cron.allow decides which users are allowed to run the crontab command.\ncron.deny decides which users are denied from using the crontab command.\nWhen cron.allow or cron.deny doesn't exist, superuser privileges are required to run it. cron.allow decides which users are allowed to run the crontab command. cron.deny decides which users are denied from using the crontab command.

Modern programming languages offer many of the features that make them appealing to programmers. DevOps engineers and automation testers often find this concept vital in preparing for interviews. Shell scripting allows the development of simple to complex scripts. A number of daily tasks can be automated using shell scripting as well. We thought of making your job easier by putting together an ensemble of the most frequently asked interview questions and sample answers on shell scripting. These interview questions will definitely help you understand that shell is basically an interface between the user and the operating system, which interprets user commands to be executed by the kernel or operating system.
