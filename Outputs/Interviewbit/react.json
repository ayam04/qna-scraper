        "question": "7. What are the differences between functional and class components?",
        "answer": "Before the introduction of Hooks in React, functional components were called stateless components and were behind class components on a feature basis. After the introduction of Hooks, functional components are equivalent to class components. Although functional components are the new trend, the react team insists on keeping class components in React. Therefore, it is important to know how these components differ. On the following basis let\u2019s compare functional and class components: Declaration Declaration Declaration Functional components are nothing but JavaScript functions and therefore can be declared using an arrow function or the function keyword: function card(props){\n   return(\n      <div className=\"main-container\">\n        <h2>Title of the card</h2>\n      </div>\n    )\n   }\n   const card = (props) =>{\n    return(\n      <div className=\"main-container\">\n        <h2>Title of the card</h2>\n      </div>\n    )\n   } function card(props){\n   return(\n      <div className=\"main-container\">\n        <h2>Title of the card</h2>\n      </div>\n    )\n   }\n   const card = (props) =>{\n    return(\n      <div className=\"main-container\">\n        <h2>Title of the card</h2>\n      </div>\n    )\n   } Class components, on the other hand, are declared using the ES6 class: class Card extends React.Component{\n  constructor(props){\n     super(props);\n   }\n    render(){\n      return(\n        <div className=\"main-container\">\n          <h2>Title of the card</h2>\n        </div>\n      )\n    }\n   } class Card extends React.Component{\n  constructor(props){\n     super(props);\n   }\n    render(){\n      return(\n        <div className=\"main-container\">\n          <h2>Title of the card</h2>\n        </div>\n      )\n    }\n   } Handling props Handling props Handling props Let\u2019s render the following component with props and analyse how functional and class components handle props: <Student Info name=\"Vivek\" rollNumber=\"23\" /> <Student Info name=\"Vivek\" rollNumber=\"23\" /> In functional components, the handling of props is pretty straightforward. Any prop provided as an argument to a functional component can be directly used inside HTML elements: function StudentInfo(props){\n   return(\n     <div className=\"main\">\n       <h2>{props.name}</h2>\n       <h4>{props.rollNumber}</h4>\n     </div>\n   )\n } function StudentInfo(props){\n   return(\n     <div className=\"main\">\n       <h2>{props.name}</h2>\n       <h4>{props.rollNumber}</h4>\n     </div>\n   )\n } In the case of class components, props are handled in a different way: class StudentInfo extends React.Component{\n   constructor(props){\n     super(props);\n    }\n    render(){\n      return(\n        <div className=\"main\">\n          <h2>{this.props.name}</h2>\n          <h4>{this.props.rollNumber}</h4> \n        </div>\n      )\n    }\n   } class StudentInfo extends React.Component{\n   constructor(props){\n     super(props);\n    }\n    render(){\n      return(\n        <div className=\"main\">\n          <h2>{this.props.name}</h2>\n          <h4>{this.props.rollNumber}</h4> \n        </div>\n      )\n    }\n   } As we can see in the code above, this keyword is used in the case of class components. this Handling state Handling state Handling state Functional components use React hooks to handle state. It uses the useState hook to set the state of a variable inside the component: function ClassRoom(props){\n   let [studentsCount,setStudentsCount] = useState(0);\n    const addStudent = () => {\n      setStudentsCount(++studentsCount);\n   }\n    return(\n      <div>\n        <p>Number of students in class room: {studentsCount}</p>\n        <button onClick={addStudent}>Add Student</button>\n      </div>\n    )\n   } function ClassRoom(props){\n   let [studentsCount,setStudentsCount] = useState(0);\n    const addStudent = () => {\n      setStudentsCount(++studentsCount);\n   }\n    return(\n      <div>\n        <p>Number of students in class room: {studentsCount}</p>\n        <button onClick={addStudent}>Add Student</button>\n      </div>\n    )\n   } Since useState hook returns an array of two items, the first item contains the current state, and the second item is a function used to update the state. In the code above, using array destructuring we have set the variable name to studentsCount with a current value of \u201c0\u201d and setStudentsCount is the function that is used to update the state. For reading the state, we can see from the code above, the variable name can be directly used to read the current state of the variable. We cannot use React Hooks inside class components, therefore state handling is done very differently in a class component: Let\u2019s take the same above example and convert it into a class component: class ClassRoom extends React.Component{\n        constructor(props){\n            super(props);\n            this.state = {studentsCount : 0};\n            \n            this.addStudent = this.addStudent.bind(this);\n         }\n            \n            addStudent(){\n            this.setState((prevState)=>{\n               return {studentsCount: prevState.studentsCount++}\n            });\n         }\n            \n            render(){\n             return(\n               <div>\n                 <p>Number of students in class room: {this.state.studentsCount}</p>\n                 <button onClick={this.addStudent}>Add Student</button>\n               </div>\n             )\n           }\n         } class ClassRoom extends React.Component{\n        constructor(props){\n            super(props);\n            this.state = {studentsCount : 0};\n            \n            this.addStudent = this.addStudent.bind(this);\n         }\n            \n            addStudent(){\n            this.setState((prevState)=>{\n               return {studentsCount: prevState.studentsCount++}\n            });\n         }\n            \n            render(){\n             return(\n               <div>\n                 <p>Number of students in class room: {this.state.studentsCount}</p>\n                 <button onClick={this.addStudent}>Add Student</button>\n               </div>\n             )\n           }\n         } In the code above, we see we are using this.state to add the variable studentsCount and setting the value to \u201c0\u201d. this.state For reading the state, we are using this.state.studentsCount. this.state.studentsCount For updating the state, we need to first bind the addStudent function to this.

        "question": "8. What is the virtual DOM? How does react use the virtual DOM to render the UI?",
        "answer": "As stated by the react team, virtual DOM is a concept where a virtual representation of the real DOM is kept inside the memory and is synced with the real DOM by a library such as ReactDOM.   Why was virtual DOM introduced? Why was virtual DOM introduced? DOM manipulation is an integral part of any web application, but DOM manipulation is quite slow when compared to other operations in JavaScript. The efficiency of the application gets affected when several DOM manipulations are being done. Most JavaScript frameworks update the entire DOM even when a small part of the DOM changes. For example, consider a list that is being rendered inside the DOM. If one of the items in the list changes, the entire list gets rendered again instead of just rendering the item that was changed/updated. This is called inefficient updating. To address the problem of inefficient updating, the react team introduced the concept of virtual DOM. How does it work? How does it work?   For every DOM object, there is a corresponding virtual DOM object(copy), which has the same properties. The main difference between the real DOM object and the virtual DOM object is that any changes in the virtual DOM object will not reflect on the screen directly. Consider a virtual DOM object as a blueprint of the real DOM object. Whenever a JSX element gets rendered, every virtual DOM object gets updated. **Note- One may think updating every virtual DOM object might be inefficient, but that\u2019s not the case. Updating the virtual DOM is much faster than updating the real DOM since we are just updating the blueprint of the real DOM. **Note- One may think updating every virtual DOM object might be inefficient, but that\u2019s not the case. Updating the virtual DOM is much faster than updating the real DOM since we are just updating the blueprint of the real DOM. React uses two virtual DOMs to render the user interface. One of them is used to store the current state of the objects and the other to store the previous state of the objects. Whenever the virtual DOM gets updated, react compares the two virtual DOMs and gets to know about which virtual DOM objects were updated. After knowing which objects were updated, react renders only those objects inside the real DOM instead of rendering the complete real DOM. This way, with the use of virtual DOM, react solves the problem of inefficient updating.",

Controlled component: In a controlled component, the value of the input element is controlled by React. We store the state of the input element inside the code, and by using event-based callbacks, any changes made to the input element will be reflected in the code as well. Controlled component: When a user enters data inside the input element of a controlled component, onChange function gets triggered and inside the code, we check whether the value entered is valid or invalid. If the value is valid, we change the state and re-render the input element with the new value. Example of a controlled component: function FormValidation(props) {\nlet [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState(\"\");\nlet updateInput = e => {\n  setInputValue(e.target.value);\n};\nreturn (\n  <div>\n    <form>\n      <input type=\"text\" value={inputValue} onChange={updateInput} />\n    </form>\n  </div>\n);\n} function FormValidation(props) {\nlet [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState(\"\");\nlet updateInput = e => {\n  setInputValue(e.target.value);\n};\nreturn (\n  <div>\n    <form>\n      <input type=\"text\" value={inputValue} onChange={updateInput} />\n    </form>\n  </div>\n);\n} As one can see in the code above, the value of the input element is determined by the state of the inputValue variable. Any changes made to the input element is handled by the updateInput function. inputValue updateInput Uncontrolled component: In an uncontrolled component, the value of the input element is handled by the DOM itself.

Uncontrolled component: In an uncontrolled component, the value of the input element is handled by the DOM itself. Input elements inside uncontrolled components work just like normal HTML input form elements. Uncontrolled component: The state of the input element is handled by the DOM. Whenever the value of the input element is changed, event-based callbacks are not called. Basically, react does not perform any action when there are changes made to the input element. Whenever use enters data inside the input field, the updated data is shown directly. To access the value of the input element, we can use ref. ref Example of an uncontrolled component: function FormValidation(props) {\nlet inputValue = React.createRef();\nlet handleSubmit = e => {\n  alert(`Input value: ${inputValue.current.value}`);\n  e.preventDefault();\n};\nreturn (\n  <div>\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <input type=\"text\" ref={inputValue} />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n    </form>\n  </div>\n);\n} function FormValidation(props) {\nlet inputValue = React.createRef();\nlet handleSubmit = e => {\n  alert(`Input value: ${inputValue.current.value}`);\n  e.preventDefault();\n};\nreturn (\n  <div>\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <input type=\"text\" ref={inputValue} />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n    </form>\n  </div>\n);\n} As one can see in the code above, we are not using onChange function to govern the changes made to the input element.

        "answer": "There are two types of side effects in React component. They are: Effects without Cleanup: This side effect will be used in useEffect which does not restrict the browser from screen update. It also improves the responsiveness of an application. A few common examples are network requests, Logging, manual DOM mutations, etc.\nEffects with Cleanup: Some of the Hook effects will require the cleanup after updating of DOM is done. For example, if you want to set up an external data source subscription, it requires cleaning up the memory else there might be a problem of memory leak. It is a known fact that React will carry out the cleanup of memory when the unmounting of components happens. But the effects will run for each render() method rather than for any specific method.

What is an error boundary? Any component which uses one of the following lifecycle methods is considered an error boundary.\nIn what places can an error boundary detect an error?  Render phase\nInside a lifecycle method\nInside the constructor Render phase Inside a lifecycle method Inside the constructor Without using error boundaries: Without using error boundaries: class CounterComponent extends React.Component{\nconstructor(props){\n  super(props);\n  this.state = {\n    counterValue: 0\n  }\n  this.incrementCounter = this.incrementCounter.bind(this);\n}\nincrementCounter(){\n  this.setState(prevState => counterValue = prevState+1);\n}\nrender(){\n  if(this.state.counter === 2){\n    throw new Error('Crashed');\n  }\n  return(\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={this.incrementCounter}>Increment Value</button>\n      <p>Value of counter: {this.state.counterValue}</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n} class CounterComponent extends React.Component{\nconstructor(props){\n  super(props);\n  this.state = {\n    counterValue: 0\n  }\n  this.incrementCounter = this.incrementCounter.bind(this);\n}\nincrementCounter(){\n  this.setState(prevState => counterValue = prevState+1);\n}\nrender(){\n  if(this.state.counter === 2){\n    throw new Error('Crashed');\n  }\n  return(\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={this.incrementCounter}>Increment Value</button>\n      <p>Value of counter: {this.state.counterValue}</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n} In the code above, when the counterValue equals 2, we throw an error inside the render method. When we are not using the error boundary, instead of seeing an error, we see a blank page. Since any error inside the render method leads to unmounting of the component. To display an error that occurs inside the render method, we use error boundaries. With error boundaries: As mentioned above, error boundary is a component using one or both of the following methods: static getDerivedStateFromError and componentDidCatch. With error boundaries: static getDerivedStateFromError and componentDidCatch. Let\u2019s create an error boundary to handle errors in the render phase: class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {\nconstructor(props) {\n  super(props);\n  this.state = { hasError: false };\n}\nstatic getDerivedStateFromError(error) {     \n  return { hasError: true }; \n}\n componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {       \n  logErrorToMyService(error, errorInfo); \n}\nrender() {\n  if (this.state.hasError) {     \n    return <h4>Something went wrong</h4>     \n  }\n  return this.props.children;\n}\n} class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {\nconstructor(props) {\n  super(props);\n  this.state = { hasError: false };\n}\nstatic getDerivedStateFromError(error) {     \n  return { hasError: true }; \n}\n componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {       \n  logErrorToMyService(error, errorInfo); \n}\nrender() {\n  if (this.state.hasError) {     \n    return <h4>Something went wrong</h4>     \n  }\n  return this.props.children;\n}\n} In the code above, getDerivedStateFromError function renders the fallback UI interface when the render method has an error. getDerivedStateFromError componentDidCatch logs the error information to an error tracking service. componentDidCatch Now with the error boundary, we can render the CounterComponent in the following way: <ErrorBoundary>\n <CounterComponent/>\n</ErrorBoundary> <ErrorBoundary>\n <CounterComponent/>\n</ErrorBoundary>",

Along with that, components have properties and states. Hooks will allow using these methods by developers for improving the reuse of code with higher flexibility navigating the component tree. Using Hook, all features of React can be used without writing class components. For example, before React version 16.8, it required a class component for managing the state of a component.

        "question": "18. What is the use of useEffect React Hooks?",
        "answer": "The useEffect React Hook is used for performing the side effects in functional components. With the help of useEffect, you will inform React that your component requires something to be done after rendering the component or after a state change. The function you have passed(can be referred to as \u201ceffect\u201d) will be remembered by React and call afterwards the performance of DOM updates is over. Using this, we can perform various calculations such as data fetching, setting up document title, manipulating DOM directly, etc, that don\u2019t target the output value. The useEffect hook will run by default after the first render and also after each update of the component. React will guarantee that the DOM will be updated by the time when the effect has run by it. The useEffect React Hook will accept 2 arguments: useEffect(callback,[dependencies]); useEffect(callback,[dependencies]); Where the first argument callback represents the function having the logic of side-effect and it will be immediately executed after changes were being pushed to DOM. The second argument dependencies represent an optional array of dependencies. The useEffect() will execute the callback only if there is a change in dependencies in between renderings. Example: Example: import { useEffect } from 'react';\nfunction WelcomeGreetings({ name }) {\n const msg = `Hi, ${name}!`;     // Calculates output\n useEffect(() => {\n   document.title = `Welcome to you ${name}`;    // Side-effect!\n }, [name]);\n return <div>{msg}</div>;         // Calculates output\n} import { useEffect } from 'react';\nfunction WelcomeGreetings({ name }) {\n const msg = `Hi, ${name}!`;     // Calculates output\n useEffect(() => {\n   document.title = `Welcome to you ${name}`;    // Side-effect!\n }, [name]);\n return <div>{msg}</div>;         // Calculates output\n} The above code will update the document title which is considered to be a side-effect as it will not calculate the component output directly. That is why updating of document title has been placed in a callback and provided to useEffect(). Consider you don\u2019t want to execute document title update each time on rendering of WelcomeGreetings component and you want it to be executed only when the name prop changes then you need to supply name as a dependency to useEffect(callback, [name]). useEffect(callback, [name])",

An installation of Node comes along with the command-line tools: npm and npx, where npm is useful to install the packages into a project and npx is useful in running commands of Node from the command line. The npx looks in the current project folder for checking whether a command has been installed there. When the command is not available on your computer, the npx will look in the npmjs.com repository, then the latest version of the command script will be loaded and will run without locally installing it. This feature is useful in creating a skeleton React application within a few key presses. Open the Terminal inside the folder of your choice, and run the following command: npx create-react-app react-items-with-hooks npx create-react-app react-items-with-hooks Here, the create-react-app is an app initializer created by Facebook, to help with the easy and quick creation of React application, providing options to customize it while creating the application? The above command will create a new folder named react-items-with-hooks and it will be initialized with a basic React application. Now, you will be able to open the project in your favourite IDE. You can see an src folder inside the project along with the main application component App.js. This file is having a single function App() which will return an element and it will make use of an extended JavaScript syntax(JSX) for defining the component. create-react-app App.js App() JSX will permit you for writing HTML-style template syntax directly into the JavaScript file. This mixture of JavaScript and HTML will be converted by React toolchain into pure JavaScript that will render the HTML element. It is possible to define your own React components by writing a function that will return a JSX element. You can try this by creating a new file src/SearchItem.jsand put the following code into it. src/SearchItem.js import React from 'react';\nexport function SearchItem() {\n return (\n   <div>\n     <div className=\"search-input\">\n       <input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"SearchItem\"/>\n     </div>\n     <h1 className=\"h1\">Search Results</h1>\n     <div className=\"items\">\n       <table>\n         <thead>\n           <tr>\n             <th className=\"itemname-col\">Item Name</th>\n             <th className=\"price-col\">Price</th>\n             <th className=\"quantity-col\">Quantity</th>\n           </tr>\n         </thead>\n         <tbody></tbody>\n       </table>\n     </div>\n   </div>\n );\n} import React from 'react';\nexport function SearchItem() {\n return (\n   <div>\n     <div className=\"search-input\">\n       <input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"SearchItem\"/>\n     </div>\n     <h1 className=\"h1\">Search Results</h1>\n     <div className=\"items\">\n       <table>\n         <thead>\n           <tr>\n             <th className=\"itemname-col\">Item Name</th>\n             <th className=\"price-col\">Price</th>\n             <th className=\"quantity-col\">Quantity</th>\n           </tr>\n         </thead>\n         <tbody></tbody>\n       </table>\n     </div>\n   </div>\n );\n} This is all about how you can create a component. It will only display the empty table and doesn\u2019t do anything. But you will be able to use the Search component in the application. Open the file src/App.js and add the import statement given below to the top of the file. src/App.js import { SearchItem } from './SearchItem'; import { SearchItem } from './SearchItem'; Now, from the logo.svg, import will be removed and then contents of returned value in the function App() will be replaced with the following code: App() <div className=\"App\">\n <header>\n   Items with Hooks\n </header>\n <SearchItem/>\n</div> <div className=\"App\">\n <header>\n   Items with Hooks\n </header>\n <SearchItem/>\n</div> You can notice that the element <SearchItem/> has been used just similar to an HTML element. The JSX syntax will enable for including the components in this approach directly within the JavaScript code. Your application can be tested by running the below-given command in your terminal. npm start npm start This command will compile your application and open your default browser into http://localhost:4000. This command can be kept on running when code development is in progress to make sure that the application is up-to-date, and also this browser page will be reloaded each time you modify and save the code. http://localhost:4000 This application will work finely, but it doesn\u2019t look nice as it doesn\u2019t react to any input from the user. You can make it more interactive by adding a state with React Hooks, adding authentication, etc.",

        "answer": "Conditional rendering refers to the dynamic output of user interface markups based on a condition state. It works in the same way as JavaScript conditions. Using conditional rendering, it is possible to toggle specific application functions, API data rendering, hide or show elements, decide permission levels, authentication handling, and so on. There are different approaches for implementing conditional rendering in React. Some of them are: Using if-else conditional logic which is suitable for smaller as well as for medium-sized applications\nUsing ternary operators, which takes away some amount of complication from if-else statements\nUsing element variables, which will enable us to write cleaner code.

        "answer": "The React Hook cannot be considered as a replacement for Redux (It is an open-source, JavaScript library useful in managing the application state) when it comes to the management of the global application state tree in large complex applications, even though the React will provide a useReducer hook that manages state transitions similar to Redux. Redux is very useful at a lower level of component hierarchy to handle the pieces of a state which are dependent on each other, instead of a declaration of multiple useState hooks. In commercial web applications which is larger, the complexity will be high, so using only React Hook may not be sufficient. Few developers will try to tackle the challenge with the help of React Hooks and others will combine React Hooks with the Redux.",

It permits us for building a single-page web application in React with navigation without even refreshing the page when the user navigates. It also allows to change the browser URL and will keep the user interface in sync with the URL. React Router will make use of the component structure for calling the components, using which appropriate information can be shown. Since React is a component-based framework, it\u2019s not necessary to include and use this package. Any other compatible routing library would also work with React. The major components of React Router are given below: BrowserRouter: It is a router implementation that will make use of the HTML5 history API (pushState, popstate, and event replaceState) for keeping your UI to be in sync with the URL. It is the parent component useful in storing all other components.\nRoutes: It is a newer component that has been introduced in the React v6 and an upgrade of the component.\nRoute: It is considered to be a conditionally shown component and some UI will be rendered by this whenever there is a match between its path and the current URL.\nLink: It is useful in creating links to various routes and implementing navigation all over the application. It works similarly to the anchor tag in HTML.

        "answer": "There are two types of Hooks in React. They are: 1. Built-in Hooks: The built-in Hooks are divided into 2 parts as given below: 1. Built-in Hooks: Basic Hooks:\nuseState(): This functional component is used to set and retrieve the state.\nuseEffect(): It enables for performing the side effects in the functional components.\nuseContext(): It is used for creating common data that is to be accessed by the components hierarchy without having to pass the props down to each level.\nAdditional Hooks:\nuseReducer() : It is used when there is a complex state logic that is having several sub-values or when the upcoming state is dependent on the previous state. It will also enable you to optimization of component performance that will trigger deeper updates as it is permitted to pass the dispatch down instead of callbacks.\nuseMemo() : This will be used for recomputing the memoized value when there is a change in one of the dependencies. This optimization will help for avoiding expensive calculations on each render.\nuseCallback() : This is useful while passing callbacks into the optimized child components and depends on the equality of reference for the prevention of unneeded renders.\nuseImperativeHandle():  It will enable modifying the instance that will be passed with the ref object.\nuseDebugValue(): It is used for displaying a label for custom hooks in React DevTools.\nuseRef() : It will permit creating a reference to the DOM element directly within the functional component.\nuseLayoutEffect(): It is used for the reading layout from the DOM and re-rendering synchronously.

Custom Hooks: A custom Hook is basically a function of JavaScript. The Custom Hook working is similar to a regular function. The \u201cuse\u201d at the beginning of the Custom Hook Name is required for React to understand that this is a custom Hook and also it will describe that this specific function follows the rules of Hooks.

        "question": "14. What are the lifecycle methods of React?",
        "answer": "React lifecycle hooks will have the methods that will be automatically called at different phases in the component lifecycle and thus it provides good control over what happens at the invoked point. It provides the power to effectively control and manipulate what goes on throughout the component lifecycle. For example, if you are developing the YouTube application, then the application will make use of a network for buffering the videos and it consumes the power of the battery (assume only these two). After playing the video if the user switches to any other application, then you should make sure that the resources like network and battery are being used most efficiently. You can stop or pause the video buffering which in turn stops the battery and network usage when the user switches to another application after video play. So we can say that the developer will be able to produce a quality application with the help of lifecycle methods and it also helps developers to make sure to plan what and how to do it at different points of birth, growth, or death of user interfaces. The various lifecycle methods are: constructor(): This method will be called when the component is initiated before anything has been done. It helps to set up the initial state and initial values.\ngetDerivedStateFromProps(): This method will be called just before element(s) rendering in the DOM. It helps to set up the state object depending on the initial props. The getDerivedStateFromProps() method will have a state as an argument and it returns an object that made changes to the state. This will be the first method to be called on an updating of a component.\nrender(): This method will output or re-render the HTML to the DOM with new changes. The render() method is an essential method and will be called always while the remaining methods are optional and will be called only if they are defined.\ncomponentDidMount(): This method will be called after the rendering of the component. Using this method, you can run statements that need the component to be already kept in the DOM.\nshouldComponentUpdate(): The Boolean value will be returned by this method which will specify whether React should proceed further with the rendering or not. The default value for this method will be True.\ngetSnapshotBeforeUpdate(): This method will provide access for the props as well as for the state before the update. It is possible to check the previously present value before the update, even after the update.\ncomponentDidUpdate(): This method will be called after the component has been updated in the DOM.\ncomponentWillUnmount(): This method will be called when the component removal from the DOM is about to happen. constructor(): This method will be called when the component is initiated before anything has been done.

        "answer": "Simply put, Higher-Order Component(HOC) is a function that takes in a component and returns a new component.   When do we need a Higher Order Component? When do we need a Higher Order Component? While developing React applications, we might develop components that are quite similar to each other with minute differences. In most cases, developing similar components might not be an issue but, while developing larger applications we need to keep our code DRY, therefore, we want an abstraction that allows us to define this logic in a single place and share it across components. HOC allows us to create that abstraction. DRY abstraction Example of a HOC: Example of a HOC: Consider the following components having similar functionality. The following component displays the list of articles: // \"GlobalDataSource\" is some global data source\nclass ArticlesList extends React.Component {\n constructor(props) {\n   super(props);\n   this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);\n   this.state = {\n     articles: GlobalDataSource.getArticles(),\n   };\n }\n componentDidMount() {\n   // Listens to the changes added\n   GlobalDataSource.addChangeListener(this.handleChange);\n }\n componentWillUnmount() {\n   // Listens to the changes removed\n   GlobalDataSource.removeChangeListener(this.handleChange);\n }\n handleChange() {\n   // States gets Update whenver data source changes\n   this.setState({\n     articles: GlobalDataSource.getArticles(),\n   });\n }\n render() {\n   return (\n     <div>\n       {this.state.articles.map((article) => (\n         <ArticleData article={article} key={article.id} />\n       ))}\n     </div>\n   );\n }\n} // \"GlobalDataSource\" is some global data source\nclass ArticlesList extends React.Component {\n constructor(props) {\n   super(props);\n   this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);\n   this.state = {\n     articles: GlobalDataSource.getArticles(),\n   };\n }\n componentDidMount() {\n   // Listens to the changes added\n   GlobalDataSource.addChangeListener(this.handleChange);\n }\n componentWillUnmount() {\n   // Listens to the changes removed\n   GlobalDataSource.removeChangeListener(this.handleChange);\n }\n handleChange() {\n   // States gets Update whenver data source changes\n   this.setState({\n     articles: GlobalDataSource.getArticles(),\n   });\n }\n render() {\n   return (\n     <div>\n       {this.state.articles.map((article) => (\n         <ArticleData article={article} key={article.id} />\n       ))}\n     </div>\n   );\n }\n} The following component displays the list of users: // \"GlobalDataSource\" is some global data source\nclass UsersList extends React.Component {\n constructor(props) {\n   super(props);\n   this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);\n   this.state = {\n     users: GlobalDataSource.getUsers(),\n   };\n }\n componentDidMount() {\n   // Listens to the changes added\n   GlobalDataSource.addChangeListener(this.handleChange);\n }\n componentWillUnmount() {\n   // Listens to the changes removed\n   GlobalDataSource.removeChangeListener(this.handleChange);\n }\n handleChange() {\n   // States gets Update whenver data source changes\n   this.setState({\n     users: GlobalDataSource.getUsers(),\n   });\n }\n render() {\n   return (\n     <div>\n       {this.state.users.map((user) => (\n         <UserData user={user} key={user.id} />\n       ))}\n     </div>\n   );\n }\n} // \"GlobalDataSource\" is some global data source\nclass UsersList extends React.Component {\n constructor(props) {\n   super(props);\n   this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);\n   this.state = {\n     users: GlobalDataSource.getUsers(),\n   };\n }\n componentDidMount() {\n   // Listens to the changes added\n   GlobalDataSource.addChangeListener(this.handleChange);\n }\n componentWillUnmount() {\n   // Listens to the changes removed\n   GlobalDataSource.removeChangeListener(this.handleChange);\n }\n handleChange() {\n   // States gets Update whenver data source changes\n   this.setState({\n     users: GlobalDataSource.getUsers(),\n   });\n }\n render() {\n   return (\n     <div>\n       {this.state.users.map((user) => (\n         <UserData user={user} key={user.id} />\n       ))}\n     </div>\n   );\n }\n} Notice the above components, both have similar functionality but, they are calling different methods to an API endpoint. Let\u2019s create a Higher Order Component to create an abstraction: // Higher Order Component which takes a component\n// as input and returns another component\n// \"GlobalDataSource\" is some global data source\nfunction HOC(WrappedComponent, selectData) {\n return class extends React.Component {\n   constructor(props) {\n     super(props);\n     this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);\n     this.state = {\n       data: selectData(GlobalDataSource, props),\n     };\n   }\n   componentDidMount() {\n     // Listens to the changes added\n     GlobalDataSource.addChangeListener(this.handleChange);\n   }\n   componentWillUnmount() {\n     // Listens to the changes removed\n     GlobalDataSource.removeChangeListener(this.handleChange);\n   }\n   handleChange() {\n     this.setState({\n       data: selectData(GlobalDataSource, this.props),\n     });\n   }\n   render() {\n     // Rendering the wrapped component with the latest data data\n     return <WrappedComponent data={this.state.data} {...this.props} />;\n   }\n };\n} // Higher Order Component which takes a component\n// as input and returns another component\n// \"GlobalDataSource\" is some global data source\nfunction HOC(WrappedComponent, selectData) {\n return class extends React.Component {\n   constructor(props) {\n     super(props);\n     this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);\n     this.state = {\n       data: selectData(GlobalDataSource, props),\n     };\n   }\n   componentDidMount() {\n     // Listens to the changes added\n     GlobalDataSource.addChangeListener(this.handleChange);\n   }\n   componentWillUnmount() {\n     // Listens to the changes removed\n     GlobalDataSource.removeChangeListener(this.handleChange);\n   }\n   handleChange() {\n     this.setState({\n       data: selectData(GlobalDataSource, this.props),\n     });\n   }\n   render() {\n     // Rendering the wrapped component with the latest data data\n     return <WrappedComponent data={this.state.data} {...this.props} />;\n   }\n };\n} We know HOC is a function that takes in a component and returns a component. In the code above, we have created a function called HOC which returns a component and performs functionality that can be shared across both the ArticlesList component and UsersList Component. ArticlesList UsersList The second parameter in the HOC function is the function that calls the method on the API endpoint. We have reduced the duplicated code of the componentDidUpdate and componentDidMount functions. componentDidUpdate componentDidMount Using the concept of Higher-Order Components, we can now render the ArticlesList and UsersList components in the following way: ArticlesList UsersList const ArticlesListWithHOC = HOC(ArticlesList, (GlobalDataSource) => GlobalDataSource.getArticles());\nconst UsersListWithHOC = HOC(UsersList, (GlobalDataSource) => GlobalDataSource.getUsers()); const ArticlesListWithHOC = HOC(ArticlesList, (GlobalDataSource) => GlobalDataSource.getArticles());\nconst UsersListWithHOC = HOC(UsersList, (GlobalDataSource) => GlobalDataSource.getUsers()); Remember, we are not trying to change the functionality of each component, we are trying to share a single functionality across multiple components using HOC.",

        "question": "17. How to pass data between react components?",
        "answer": "  Parent Component to Child Component (using props) Parent Component to Child Component (using props) With the help of props, we can send data from a parent to a child component. How do we do this? How do we do this? Consider the following Parent Component: import ChildComponent from \"./Child\";\n   function ParentComponent(props) {\n    let [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);\n   \n    let increment = () => setCounter(++counter);\n   \n    return (\n      <div>\n        <button onClick={increment}>Increment Counter</button>\n        <ChildComponent counterValue={counter} />\n      </div>\n    );\n   } import ChildComponent from \"./Child\";\n   function ParentComponent(props) {\n    let [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);\n   \n    let increment = () => setCounter(++counter);\n   \n    return (\n      <div>\n        <button onClick={increment}>Increment Counter</button>\n        <ChildComponent counterValue={counter} />\n      </div>\n    );\n   } As one can see in the code above, we are rendering the child component inside the parent component, by providing a prop called counterValue. The value of the counter is being passed from the parent to the child component. We can use the data passed by the parent component in the following way: function ChildComponent(props) {\nreturn (\n  <div>\n    <p>Value of counter: {props.counterValue}</p>\n  </div>\n);\n} function ChildComponent(props) {\nreturn (\n  <div>\n    <p>Value of counter: {props.counterValue}</p>\n  </div>\n);\n} We use the props.counterValue to display the data passed on by the parent component. props.counterValue Child Component to Parent Component (using callbacks) Child Component to Parent Component (using callbacks) This one is a bit tricky. We follow the steps below: Create a callback in the parent component which takes in the data needed as a parameter.\nPass this callback as a prop to the child component.\nSend data from the child component using the callback. Create a callback in the parent component which takes in the data needed as a parameter. Pass this callback as a prop to the child component. Send data from the child component using the callback. We are considering the same example above but in this case, we are going to pass the updated counterValue from child to parent. Step1 and Step2: Create a callback in the parent component, pass this callback as a prop. Step1 and Step2: function ParentComponent(props) {\nlet [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);\nlet callback = valueFromChild => setCounter(valueFromChild);\nreturn (\n  <div>\n    <p>Value of counter: {counter}</p>\n    <ChildComponent callbackFunc={callback} counterValue={counter} />\n  </div>\n);\n} function ParentComponent(props) {\nlet [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);\nlet callback = valueFromChild => setCounter(valueFromChild);\nreturn (\n  <div>\n    <p>Value of counter: {counter}</p>\n    <ChildComponent callbackFunc={callback} counterValue={counter} />\n  </div>\n);\n} As one can see in the code above, we created a function called callback which takes in the data received from the child component as a parameter. Next, we passed the function callback as a prop to the child component. Step3: Pass data from the child to the parent component. Step3: function ChildComponent(props) {\nlet childCounterValue = props.counterValue;\nreturn (\n  <div>\n    <button onClick={() => props.callbackFunc(++childCounterValue)}>\n      Increment Counter\n    </button>\n  </div>\n);\n} function ChildComponent(props) {\nlet childCounterValue = props.counterValue;\nreturn (\n  <div>\n    <button onClick={() => props.callbackFunc(++childCounterValue)}>\n      Increment Counter\n    </button>\n  </div>\n);\n} In the code above, we have used the props.counterValue and set it to a variable called childCounterValue. Next, on button click, we pass the incremented childCounterValue to the props.callbackFunc. props.callbackFunc This way, we can pass data from the child to the parent component.",
