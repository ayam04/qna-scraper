        "question": "15. What do you understand about the Redux Saga?",
        "answer": "Redux Saga is a middleware library that can be useful for allowing a Redux store to interact with the resources outside of itself in an asynchronous manner, for example, making HTTP requests to external services, accessing browser storage, executing Input/Output operations and many more. These operations are also called side effects.",

        "question": "16. What are the things which we should never do inside a reducer?",
        "answer": "The things which we should never do inside a reducer are as follows: Modify the argument of the reducer\nWe should assure that we do not perform any side operations such as routing transitions, API calls, etc.\nWe should not call non-pure functions, for instance Date.now(), Math.random(), etc. Modify the argument of the reducer We should assure that we do not perform any side operations such as routing transitions, API calls, etc. We should not call non-pure functions, for instance Date.now(), Math.random(), etc.",

        "question": "17. How can the addition of multiple middlewares to Redux be done?",
        "answer": "In order to add multiple middlewares to Redux, the usage of applyMiddleware can do the work. In applyMiddleware, we can pass every piece of middleware as a new argument. Therefore, our job is to just pass each piece of middleware that we want. In the example given below, we have added Redux Thunk and logger middlewares as an argument: import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'\nconst createStoreWithMiddleware = applyMiddleware(ReduxThunk, logger)(createStore); import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'\nconst createStoreWithMiddleware = applyMiddleware(ReduxThunk, logger)(createStore); Conclusion The purpose of this article was to explain to our readers what Redux actually is, what is it used for and what are the most important questions asked in the interviews. It is one of the most important JavaScript libraries which is being used alongside React for building a number of applications seamlessly and therefore, we would suggest that any budding talent of today should be familiar with the concepts of Redux to get an edge over others.
