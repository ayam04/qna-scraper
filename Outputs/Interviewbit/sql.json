        "question": "1. What is Pattern Matching in SQL?",
        "answer": "SQL pattern matching provides for pattern search in data if you have no clue as to what that word should be. This kind of SQL query uses wildcards to match a string pattern, rather than writing the exact word. The LIKE operator is used in conjunction with SQL Wildcards to fetch the required information. SQL Wildcards Using the % wildcard to perform a simple search Using the % wildcard to perform a simple search Using the % wildcard to perform a simple search The % wildcard matches zero or more characters of any type and can be used to define wildcards both before and after the pattern. Search a student in your database with first name beginning with the letter K: SELECT *\nFROM students\nWHERE first_name LIKE 'K%' SELECT *\nFROM students\nWHERE first_name LIKE 'K%' SELECT * FROM WHERE LIKE 'K%' Omitting the patterns using the NOT keyword Omitting the patterns using the NOT keyword Omitting the patterns using the NOT keyword Use the NOT keyword to select records that don't match the pattern. This query returns all students whose first name does not begin with K. SELECT *\nFROM students\nWHERE first_name NOT LIKE 'K%' SELECT *\nFROM students\nWHERE first_name NOT LIKE 'K%' SELECT * FROM WHERE NOT LIKE 'K%' Matching a pattern anywhere using the % wildcard twice Matching a pattern anywhere using the % wildcard twice Matching a pattern anywhere using the % wildcard twice Search for a student in the database where he/she has a K in his/her first name. SELECT *\nFROM students\nWHERE first_name LIKE '%Q%' SELECT *\nFROM students\nWHERE first_name LIKE '%Q%' SELECT * FROM WHERE LIKE '%Q%' Using the _ wildcard to match pattern at a specific position Using the _ wildcard to match pattern at a specific position Using the _ wildcard to match pattern at a specific position The _ wildcard matches exactly one character of any type. It can be used in conjunction with % wildcard. This query fetches all students with letter K at the third position in their first name. SELECT *\nFROM students\nWHERE first_name LIKE '__K%' SELECT *\nFROM students\nWHERE first_name LIKE '__K%' SELECT * FROM WHERE LIKE '__K%' Matching patterns for a specific length Matching patterns for a specific length Matching patterns for a specific length The _ wildcard plays an important role as a limitation when it matches exactly one character. It limits the length and position of the matched results. For example - SELECT *   /* Matches first names with three or more letters */\nFROM students\nWHERE first_name LIKE '___%'\n\nSELECT *   /* Matches first names with exactly four characters */\nFROM students\nWHERE first_name LIKE '____' SELECT *   /* Matches first names with three or more letters */\nFROM students\nWHERE first_name LIKE '___%'\n\nSELECT *   /* Matches first names with exactly four characters */\nFROM students\nWHERE first_name LIKE '____' SELECT * /* Matches first names with three or more letters */ FROM WHERE LIKE '___%' SELECT * /* Matches first names with exactly four characters */ FROM WHERE LIKE '____'",

        "answer": "Creating empty tables with the same structure can be done smartly by fetching the records of one table into a new table using the INTO operator while fixing a WHERE clause to be false for all records. Hence, SQL prepares the new table with a duplicate structure to accept the fetched records but since no records get fetched due to the WHERE clause in action, nothing is inserted into the new table.

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX myIndex\nON students (enroll_no); CREATE UNIQUE INDEX myIndex\nON students (enroll_no); CREATE UNIQUE ON Non-unique indexes, on the other hand, are not used to enforce constraints on the tables with which they are associated. Instead, non-unique indexes are used solely to improve query performance by maintaining a sorted order of data values that are used frequently. Clustered and Non-Clustered Index: Clustered and Non-Clustered Index: Clustered and Non-Clustered Index: Clustered indexes are indexes whose order of the rows in the database corresponds to the order of the rows in the index. This is why only one clustered index can exist in a given table, whereas, multiple non-clustered indexes can exist in the table. The only difference between clustered and non-clustered indexes is that the database manager attempts to keep the data in the database in the same order as the corresponding keys appear in the clustered index.

A relation in 2NF has no partial dependency, i.e., it has no non-prime attribute that depends on any proper subset of any candidate key of the table. Often, specifying a single column Primary Key is the solution to the problem. Examples - no partial dependency Example 1 - Consider the above example. As we can observe, the Students Table in the 1NF form has a candidate key in the form of [Student, Address] that can uniquely identify all records in the table. The field Books Issued (non-prime attribute) depends partially on the Student field. Hence, the table is not in 2NF. To convert it into the 2nd Normal Form, we will partition the tables into two while specifying a new Primary Key attribute to identify the individual records in the Students table.

Third Normal Form Third Normal Form Third Normal Form A relation is said to be in the third normal form, if it satisfies the conditions for the second normal form and there is no transitive dependency between the non-prime attributes, i.e., all non-prime attributes are determined only by the candidate keys of the relation and not by any other non-prime attribute. no transitive dependency Example 1 - Consider the Students Table in the above example. As we can observe, the Students Table in the 2NF form has a single candidate key Student_ID (primary key) that can uniquely identify all records in the table. The field Salutation (non-prime attribute), however, depends on the Student Field rather than the candidate key. Hence, the table is not in 3NF. To convert it into the 3rd Normal Form, we will once again partition the tables into two while specifying a new Foreign Key constraint to identify the salutations for individual records in the Students table. The Primary Key constraint for the same will be set on the Salutations table to identify each record uniquely.

This approach is used for effectively increasing the query performance while dealing with large database tables. To create a partition, a key called partition key which is usually a table column or an expression, and a partitioning method needs to be defined. There are three types of inbuilt partitioning methods provided by Postgres: Range Partitioning: This method is done by partitioning based on a range of values. This method is most commonly used upon date fields to get monthly, weekly or yearly data. In the case of corner cases like value belonging to the end of the range, for example: if the range of partition 1 is 10-20 and the range of partition 2 is 20-30, and the given value is 10, then 10 belongs to the second partition and not the first.\nList Partitioning: This method is used to partition based on a list of known values. Most commonly used when we have a key with a categorical value. For example, getting sales data based on regions divided as countries, cities, or states.\nHash Partitioning: This method utilizes a hash function upon the partition key. This is done when there are no specific requirements for data division and is used to access data individually. For example, you want to access data based on a specific product, then using hash partition would result in the dataset that we require.

This is undoubtedly inefficient for a system dealing with huge data. Now if this system had an index on the column where we are applying search, it can use an efficient method for identifying matching rows by walking through only a few levels. This is called indexing.

SQL standards define 4 levels of transaction isolations to deal with these phenomena. Dirty reads: If a transaction reads data that is written due to concurrent uncommitted transaction, these reads are called dirty reads.\nPhantom reads: This occurs when two same queries when executed separately return different rows. For example, if transaction A retrieves some set of rows matching search criteria. Assume another transaction B retrieves new rows in addition to the rows obtained earlier for the same search criteria. The results are different.\nNon-repeatable reads: This occurs when a transaction tries to read the same row multiple times and gets different values each time due to concurrency. This happens when another transaction updates that data and our current transaction fetches that updated data, resulting in different values.

This happens when another transaction updates that data and our current transaction fetches that updated data, resulting in different values. Non-repeatable reads To tackle these, there are 4 standard isolation levels defined by SQL standards. They are as follows: Read Uncommitted \u2013 The lowest level of the isolations. Here, the transactions are not isolated and can read data that are not committed by other transactions resulting in dirty reads.\nRead Committed \u2013 This level ensures that the data read is committed at any instant of read time. Hence, dirty reads are avoided here. This level makes use of read/write lock on the current rows which prevents read/write/update/delete of that row when the current transaction is being operated on.\nRepeatable Read \u2013 The most restrictive level of isolation. This holds read and write locks for all rows it operates on. Due to this, non-repeatable reads are avoided as other transactions cannot read, write, update or delete the rows.\nSerializable \u2013 The highest of all isolation levels. This guarantees that the execution is serializable where execution of any concurrent operations are guaranteed to be appeared as executing serially.

        "answer": "We can achieve this by using the pg_dump tool for dumping all object contents in the database into a single file. The steps are as follows: Step 1: Navigate to the bin folder of the PostgreSQL installation path. Step 1 C:\\>cd C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\10.0\\bin C:\\>cd C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\10.0\\bin Step 2: Execute pg_dump program to take the dump of data to a .tar folder as shown below: Step 2: pg_dump -U postgres -W -F t sample_data > C:\\Users\\admin\\pgbackup\\sample_data.tar pg_dump -U postgres -W -F t sample_data > C:\\Users\\admin\\pgbackup\\sample_data.tar The database dump will be stored in the sample_data.tar file on the location specified.",

        "question": "25. Differentiate between commit and checkpoint.",
        "answer": "The commit action ensures that the data consistency of the transaction is maintained and it ends the current transaction in the section. Commit adds a new record in the log that describes the COMMIT to the memory. Whereas, a checkpoint is used for writing all changes that were committed to disk up to SCN which would be kept in datafile headers and control files. Conclusion: SQL is a language for the database. It has a vast scope and robust capability of creating and manipulating a variety of database objects using commands like CREATE, ALTER, DROP, etc, and also in loading the database objects using commands like INSERT. It also provides options for Data Manipulation using commands like DELETE, TRUNCATE and also does effective retrieval of data using cursor commands like FETCH, SELECT, etc. There are many such commands which provide a large amount of control to the programmer to interact with the database in an efficient way without wasting many resources. The popularity of SQL has grown so much that almost every programmer relies on this to implement their application's storage functionalities thereby making it an exciting language to learn. Learning this provides the developer a benefit of understanding the data structures used for storing the organization's data and giving an additional level of control and in-depth understanding of the application. PostgreSQL being an open-source database system having extremely robust and sophisticated ACID, Indexing, and Transaction supports has found widespread popularity among the developer community.
