        "question": "13. Is it possible to design applications that handle connection failure in Azure?",
        "answer": "Yes, it is possible and is done by means of the Transient Fault Handling Block. There can be multiple causes of transient failures while using the cloud environment: Due to the presence of more load balancers, we can see that the application to database connections fail periodically.\nWhile using multi-tenant services, the calls get slower and eventually time out because other applications are using resources to hit the same resource heavily.\nThe last cause can be we ourselves as the user trying to hit the resource very frequently which causes the service to deliberately deny the connection to us to support other tenants in the architecture. Due to the presence of more load balancers, we can see that the application to database connections fail periodically. While using multi-tenant services, the calls get slower and eventually time out because other applications are using resources to hit the same resource heavily. The last cause can be we ourselves as the user trying to hit the resource very frequently which causes the service to deliberately deny the connection to us to support other tenants in the architecture. Instead of showing errors to the user periodically, the application can recognize the errors that are transient and automatically try to perform the same operation again typically after some seconds with the hope of establishing the connection. By making use of the Transient Fault Handling Application Block mechanism, we can generate the retry intervals and make the application perform retries. In the majority of the cases, the error would be resolved on the second try and hence the user need not be made aware of these errors unnecessarily. Following is the sample code that can be used for the retry policy. Here, if the connection is not successful, then the action is retried based on the retry policy defined.

The infrastructure is used for hosting applications. Examples include Azure VM, VNET, etc. IaaS: PaaS: PaaS stands for \u201cPlatform as a Service\u201d which is mostly about underlying infrastructure abstraction to the developers for enabling quicker development of the applications without the need for worry about hosting management. Examples include Azure web apps, Storage services, cloud services, etc. PaaS: SaaS: SaaS stands for \u201cSoftware as a Service\u201d and are those applications which are delivered using the service delivery model where the applications are simply consumed and used by an organization. These applications are generally mobilized by making the organization pay for their usage or through ads. Examples include applications like Office 365, Gmail, SharePoint Online, and so on.
