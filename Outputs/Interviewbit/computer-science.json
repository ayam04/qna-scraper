        "question": "14. Is string class final?",
        "answer": "Yes. The string class is final. This means that you cannot subclass it, and you cannot override its methods. This is a good thing because it means that you can use the string class without worrying about its internal state. There are a few things that you can do to subclass the string class, though. First, you can use StringBuilder to create a subclass of the string class. This class can then override the methods that you need to override to create your own subclass of the string class. Second, you can use StringBuffer to create a subclass of the string class. This class can then override the methods that you need to override to create your own subclass of the string class. Finally, you can use StringBuilder and StringBuffer together to create a subclass of the string class.",

        "question": "15. What is a singleton class?",
        "answer": "A singleton class is a class that is defined once and only once. This can be used to reduce the number of classes you need to define in your application, and it can also be used to reduce the complexity of your code. When you define a singleton class, you are declaring that the class is only ever going to be created once. This can be useful if you want to reduce the number of instances that your class will have to create, and it can also be useful if you want to reduce the complexity of your code. Singleton classes are often used when you need to create a single instance of a class, but you don't want that instance to be shared across multiple objects. For example, if you want to create a single instance of a class that represents an image, you might create a singleton class that represents that image.",

        "question": "16. What is cryptography?",
        "answer": "Cryptography is the science and art of creating and using codes and ciphers to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or destruction. Cryptography is used to protect data from unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure. Cryptography can also be used to secure data transmissions, such as e-mail and web browsing. Cryptography also plays an important role in the security of computer networks, such as the Internet. Codes and ciphers are used to encode and decode information. For example, when you type in a password on a computer, the computer uses a code to encrypt the password. When you send an e-mail, you use a code to encrypt the message.  ",

        "answer": "The World Wide Web (or WWW) is a collection of interconnected data networks that enable people to share information, documents, and programs across the Internet. The web is made up of hundreds of different websites, each of which contains information about a particular topic or subject. These websites are organized into a hierarchy called a \u201cweb page\u201d that describes the content of the page and links to other pages. Web pages can be written in many different languages, and they can be organized in many different ways, including using tabs and links. The web is a powerful tool for sharing information because it enables people to easily access information from anywhere on the planet. For example, you can access information about any topic you want from any computer or device that has Internet access. You can also use the web to share documents and programs with other people who have access to the same devices as you do.",

        "answer": "The primary memory in programming is the data structure that is used to store the information that is used by the program to control the execution of the program. The primary memory is composed of variables, constants, and data types. The variables are used to store information about the current state of the program. The constants are used to store values that are known at compile-time and are needed by the program when it is run. The data types are used to store values that are known at runtime and are needed by the program when it is run. The primary memory in programming is composed of three different types of data structures: Variables - These are used to store information about the current state of the program. Variables can be used to store values such as numbers, strings, and booleans.\nConstants - These are used to store values that are known at compile-time and are needed by the program when it is run. Constants can be used to store values such as integers, floating-point numbers, and booleans.\nData types - These are used to store values that are known at runtime and are needed by the program when it is run.
