We can store more data and handle more load without requiring larger or more powerful machines, by putting a subset of data on each machine.\nIn the figure below, RS0 and RS1 are shards.

        "question": "4. What are Geospatial Indexes in MongoDB?",
        "answer": "MongoDB has two types of geospatial indexes: 2dsphere and 2d. 2dsphere indexes work with spherical geometries that model the surface of the earth based on the WGS84 datum. This datum model the surface of the earth as an oblate spheroid, meaning that there is some flattening at the poles. Distance calculations using 2sphere indexes, therefore, take the shape of the earth into account and provide a more accurate treatment of distance between, for example, two cities, than do 2d indexes. Use 2d indexes for points stored on a two-dimensional plane. 2dsphere allows you to specify geometries for points, lines, and polygons in the GeoJSON format. A point is given by a two-element array, representing [longitude, latitude]: {\n   \"name\" : \"New York City\",\n   \"loc\" : {\n       \"type\" : \"Point\",\n       \"coordinates\" : [50, 2]\n   }\n} {\n   \"name\" : \"New York City\",\n   \"loc\" : {\n       \"type\" : \"Point\",\n       \"coordinates\" : [50, 2]\n   }\n} A line is given by an array of points: {\n   \"name\" : \"Hudson River\",\n   \"loc\" : {\n       \"type\" : \"LineString\",\n       \"coordinates\" : [[0,1], [0,2], [1,2]]\n   }\n} {\n   \"name\" : \"Hudson River\",\n   \"loc\" : {\n       \"type\" : \"LineString\",\n       \"coordinates\" : [[0,1], [0,2], [1,2]]\n   }\n}",

The index stores the value of the specific field or set of fields, ordered by the value of the field as specified in the index. \nMongoDB\u2019s indexes work almost identically to typical relational database indexes.  Indexes look at an ordered list with references to the content. These in turn allow MongoDB to query orders of magnitude faster. To create an index, use the createIndex collection method. createIndex For example: > db.users.find({\"username\": \"user101\"}).explain(\"executionStats\") > db.users.find({\"username\": \"user101\"}).explain(\"executionStats\") Here, executionStats mode helps us understand the effect of using an index to satisfy queries. executionStats",

With an aggregation pipeline, we take input from a MongoDB collection and pass the documents from that collection through one or more stages, each of which performs a different operation on its inputs (See figure below).
