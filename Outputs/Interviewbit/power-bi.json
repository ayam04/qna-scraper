        "question": "1. How would you define Power BI as an effective solution?",
        "answer": "Power BI is a strong business analytical tool that creates useful insights and reports by collating data from unrelated sources. This data can be extracted from any source like Microsoft Excel or hybrid data warehouses. Power BI drives an extreme level of utility and purpose using interactive graphical interface and visualizations. You can create reports using the Excel BI toolkit and share them on-cloud with your colleagues.",

        "answer": "In power BI, you have various kinds of views viz: Data View: Curating, exploring, and viewing data tables in the data set. Unlike, Power Query editor, with data view, you are looking at the data after it has been fed to the model.\nModel View: This view shows you all the tables along with their complex relationships. With this, you can break these complex models into simplified diagrams or set properties for them at once.\nReport View: The report view displays the tables in an interactive format to simplify data analysis. You can create n number of reports, provide visualizations, merge them, or apply any such functionality. Data View: Curating, exploring, and viewing data tables in the data set.

Interestingly, Power BI will only store the metadata of the data tables involved and not the actual data. The supported sources of data query are: Direct Query: Amazon Redshift\nAzure HDInsight Spark (Beta)\nAzure SQL Database\nAzure SQL Data Warehouse\nIBM Netezza (Beta)\nImpala (version 2.x)\nOracle Database (version 12 and above)\nSAP Business Warehouse (Beta)\nSAP HANA\nSnowflake\nSpark (Beta) (version 0.9 and above)\nSQL Server\nTeradata Database Amazon Redshift Azure HDInsight Spark (Beta) Azure SQL Database Azure SQL Data Warehouse IBM Netezza (Beta) Impala (version 2.x) Oracle Database (version 12 and above) SAP Business Warehouse (Beta) SAP HANA Snowflake Spark (Beta) (version 0.9 and above) SQL Server Teradata Database Live Connection: Live connection is analogous to the direct query method as it doesn\u2019t store any data in Power BI either. But opposed to the direct query method, it is a direct connection to the analysis services model. Also, the supported data sources with live connection method are limited: Live Connection: SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) Tabular\nSQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) Multi-Dimensional\nPower BI Service SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) Tabular SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) Multi-Dimensional Power BI Service Import Data (Scheduled Refresh): By choosing this method, you upload the data into Power BI. Uploading data on Power BI means consuming the memory space of your Power BI desktop. If it is on the website, it consumes the space of the Power BI cloud machine. Even though it is the fastest method, the maximum size of the file to be uploaded cannot exceed 1 GB until and unless you have Power BI premium (then you have 50 GB at the expense).
