        "question": "2. Differentiate between threat, vulnerability and risk.",
        "answer": "Threat: A threat is any form of hazard that has the potential to destroy or steal data, disrupt operations, or cause harm in general. Malware, phishing, data breaches, and even unethical employees are all examples of threats.\nThreat actors, who might be individuals or groups with a variety of backgrounds and motives, express threats. Understanding threats is essential for developing effective mitigations and making informed cybersecurity decisions. Threat intelligence is information regarding threats and threat actors. Threat:  Vulnerability: A vulnerability is a flaw in hardware, software, personnel, or procedures that threat actors can use to achieve their objectives.\nPhysical vulnerabilities, such as publicly exposed networking equipment, software vulnerabilities, such as a buffer overflow vulnerability in a browser, and even human vulnerabilities, such as an employee vulnerable to phishing assaults, are all examples of vulnerabilities.\nVulnerability management is the process of identifying, reporting and repairing vulnerabilities. A zero-day vulnerability is a vulnerability for which a remedy is not yet available. Vulnerability:   Risk: The probability of a threat and the consequence of a vulnerability are combined to form risk. To put it another way, the risk is the likelihood of a threat agent successfully exploiting a vulnerability, which may be calculated using the formula: Risk: Risk = Likelihood of a threat * Vulnerability Impact Risk = Likelihood of a threat * Vulnerability Impact Risk management is the process of identifying all potential hazards, analyzing their impact, and determining the best course of action. It's a never-ending procedure that examines new threats and vulnerabilities on a regular basis. Risks can be avoided, minimized, accepted, or passed to a third party depending on the response chosen.  ",

        "question": "3. What does XSS stand for? How can it be prevented?",
        "answer": "XSS stands for Cross-site scripting. It is a web security flaw that allows an attacker to manipulate how users interact with a susceptible application. It allows an attacker to get around the same-origin policy, which is meant to keep websites separate from one another. Cross-site scripting flaws allow an attacker to impersonate a victim user and execute any actions that the user is capable of, as well as access any of the user's data. If the victim user has privileged access to the application, the attacker may be able to take complete control of the app's functionality and data.   Preventing cross-site scripting can be simple in some circumstances, but it can be much more difficult in others, depending on the application's sophistication and how it handles user-controllable data. In general, preventing XSS vulnerabilities will almost certainly need a mix of the following measures:\nOn arrival, filter the input. Filter user input as precisely as feasible at the point when it is received, based on what is expected or valid input.\nOn the output, encode the data. Encode user-controllable data in HTTP responses at the point where it is output to avoid it being perceived as active content. Depending on the output context, a combination of HTML, URL, JavaScript, and CSS encoding may be required.\nUse headers that are relevant for the response. You can use the Content-Type and X-Content-Type-Options headers to ensure that browsers read HTTP responses in the way you intend, preventing XSS in HTTP responses that aren't intended to contain any HTML or JavaScript.\nPolicy for Content Security. You can utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) as a last line of defense to mitigate the severity of any remaining XSS issues.  On arrival, filter the input.  On the output, encode the data.  Use headers that are relevant for the response.  Policy for Content Security.",

        "answer": "The primary goal of cyber security is to protect data. To safeguard data from cyber-attacks, the security sector offers a triangle of three connected principles. The CIA trio is the name for this principle. The CIA model is intended to help organizations develop policies for their information security architecture. One or more of these principles has been broken when a security breach is discovered. Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are the three components of the CIA model. It's a security paradigm that guides individuals through many aspects of IT security. Let's take a closer look at each section.   Confidentiality: Confidentiality is the same as privacy in that it prevents unauthorized access to data. It entails ensuring that the data is only accessible to those who are authorized to use it, as well as restricting access to others. It keeps vital information from getting into the wrong hands. Data encryption is a great example of keeping information private.\nIntegrity: This principle assures that the data is genuine, correct, and safe from unwanted threat actors or unintentional user alteration. If any changes are made, precautions should be taken to protect sensitive data from corruption or loss, as well as to quickly recover from such an incident. Furthermore, it denotes that the source of information must be genuine.\nAvailability: This principle ensures that information is constantly available and helpful to those who have access to it. It ensures that system failures or cyber-attacks do not obstruct these accesses. Confidentiality:  Integrity:  Availability:",

        "answer": "  Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) scan and monitor network traffic for signals that attackers are attempting to infiltrate or steal data from your network using a known cyber threat. IDS systems detect a variety of activities such as security policy violations, malware, and port scanners by comparing current network activity to a known threat database.\nIntrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are located between the outside world and the internal network, in the same area of the network as a firewall. If a packet represents a known security hazard, an IPS will proactively prohibit network traffic based on a security profile.\nThe fundamental distinction is that an IDS is a monitoring system, whereas an IPS is a control system. IDS makes no changes to network packets, whereas IPS block packet delivery depending on the contents of the packet, similar to how a firewall blocks traffic based on IP address.

        "answer": "We must decide what to encrypt and where the encryption mechanism should be situated if encryption is to be used to counter attacks on confidentiality. Link and end-to-end encryption are the two main ways of encryption placement.\nEnd-to-end encryption, or E2EE, is a secure data transfer system in which data is encrypted and decrypted only at the endpoints, regardless of how many points it passes through in the middle of its virtual journey. This sort of encryption is an excellent technique to communicate in a secure and confidential manner. Because no one else has the key to decode it, no one in the middle will be able to read it.\nThe primary difference between link encryption and end-to-end encryption is that link encryption encrypts and decrypts all traffic at all points, not just at the endpoints. All data is encrypted as it travels along the communication line with this approach. When it reaches a router or another intermediary device, however, it is decrypted so that the intermediator can determine which direction to send it next.  End-to-end encryption  link encryption  ",

Polymorphic viruses encrypt their programming and employ various encryption keys each time to alter their physical file makeup throughout each infection.\nMutation engines are used by polymorphic viruses to change their decryption routines every time they infect a machine. Because typical security solutions do not use a static, unchanging code, traditional security solutions may miss them. They are considerably more difficult to detect because they use complicated mutation engines that generate billions of decryption routines.   ",

Perfect forward secrecy is another name for it (PFS).\nThe \"Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange\" algorithm is used to accomplish this.  Conclusion: Cybersecurity is critical because it safeguards all types of data against theft and loss. Sensitive data, personally identifiable information (PII), protected health information (PHI), personal information, intellectual property, data, and governmental and industry information systems all fall under this category.\nYour company won't be able to defend itself if it doesn't have a cybersecurity program.\nCyber security awareness is defined as the knowledge of an action taken to secure a company's information assets. When employees at a company are cyber security conscious, it implies they understand what cyber dangers are, the possible impact a cyber-attack will have on their company, and the procedures necessary to reduce risk and prevent cyber-crime from penetrating their online workspace.\nTo learn more about Cyber Security, you can go through the following references:-    Hacking: The Art of Exploitation by Jon Erickson\nPractical Malware Analysis by Michael Sikorski Hacking: The Art of Exploitation by Jon Erickson Practical Malware Analysis by Michael Sikorski  Useful Resources Useful Resources Security Engineer Salary\nCyber Security Salary in India\nCyber Security Projects Security Engineer Salary Security Engineer Salary Cyber Security Salary in India Cyber Security Salary in India Cyber Security Projects Cyber Security Projects",
