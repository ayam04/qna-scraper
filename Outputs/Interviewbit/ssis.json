        "answer": "During the process of transferring millions of records from one source to a destination, the probability of errors always exists. It is very important to identify the records that are errored out and ensure the transmission of records is smooth with no errors to the destination. To identify the errors, the errors need to be logged. The components of SSIS - source, transformation, and the destination - all have had support to log errors to output by means of secondary pipe by providing means to define behaviors while errors occur.   The secondary pipe or the error flow can be connected to another transformation or a destination component depending on the requirement. The error log can contain details regarding the error columns, error descriptions, and error codes.",

        "answer": "The SSIS connection manager has issues in storing the password. Hence we can follow the below-proposed solutions: Method 1: Create and use SQL Server Agent Proxy account which uses credential that makes SQL Server Agent capable of the running job as an account having required permissions to run the job or as the account which created the package.\nThis method is used for decrypting secrets and key requirements of the user are satisfied.\nThere are chances that this method could fail because the secrets are decrypted by taking the current user and current computer information which will inadvertently fail if the project or package is moved to a different computer.\nMethod 2: Set the value of Package Protection Level Property to Server Storage. This stores packages on the SQL Server and lets users access this through SQL Server database roles.\nMethod 3: Set the value of Package Protection Level property as \u201cEncrypt Sensitive with Password\u201d. The method uses a password for encrypting sensitive information. This can be added to the SQL Server Agent job to run the job effectively.\nMethod 4: Package configuration can be used to save sensitive information which can later be stored in a secured folder. When the package is run, the information is obtained from this config file. If we do not want to save the secrets in the package, we can set the property of Protection Level to \u201cDontSaveSensitive\u201d.\nMethod 5: Package templates having a good protection level can be created for long-term solutions.

        "question": "13. Difference between Merge Transformation and Union all transformations.",
        "answer": "Merge Transformation: This does the task of merging data from 2 sources to single output. This is useful when we need to break the data flow path to a separate error path and once the error is handled, merge that back to the main data flow. To apply this transformation, the data should be sorted first and the metadata information for the 2 paths should be the same. The sorting can be done by applying sort transformation before the merge or by providing an ORDER BY clause in the source connection. Merge Transformation   Union All Transformation: Union all transformation working is similar to merge transformation but the only difference is that this does not require sorted data. Data from different sources are transformed and combined into a single output. Union All Transformation",

        "question": "14. Define Data Flow in SSIS.",
        "answer": "Data flow is the data transferring process from the source to a specified donation. It defines the way how data or information is sent from one point to other. It consists of 3 main components:   SSIS gives control to the users to perform the data transformation process from source to destination utilizing various built-in transformation components. The components provided by the SSIS helps users in data cleaning and manipulation in the pipeline. For achieving this, the user needs to attach a data flow task to the package control flow which is later executed within the package by creating, ordering, and running the data flow. It is worthy to note that each data flow task has a separate data flow engine instance.  ",

        "question": "15. How is the deployment utility created in SSIS?",
        "answer": "Deployment is nothing but a process of updating the state of the package from development mode to executable mode. Deployment in SSIS can be done by simply performing the right-click operation on the \u201cIntegration Services Project\u201d and clicking on the build option. This would create a \u201cpackage.dtsx\u201d file inside the bin folder named \u201cprojectbin\u201d. The utility helps in deploying packages at SQL server or as an executable file on a specified location. build Following are the steps followed to create a deployment utility: Go to Project and right-click on it.\nDouble click on the properties.\nChoose the path location for deployment by selecting the box next to \u201cTrue\u201d under Create Deployment Utility.\nSave changes. Close this window.\nRight-click again on the project and select the build option.
