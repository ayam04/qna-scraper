        "question": "3. What is a Vue instance? How can we create a Vue instance?",
        "answer": "The Vue instance is the root of your application. It is a Vue class instance that represents the ViewModel in the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture paradigm. The Vue instance is responsible for generating and managing the component hierarchy, as well as handling data, state management, event, and lifecycle hook. To create a Vue instance, we simply create a new instance of the Vue class and pass in an options object that defines the properties and behavior of the instance. Consider below the example of creating a basic Vue instance: var app = new Vue({\n  el: '#app',\n  data: {\n    message: 'Hello Vue!'\n  }\n}) var app = new Vue({\n  el: '#app',\n  data: {\n    message: 'Hello Vue!'\n  }\n}) In this example, we have created a new Vue instance and passed in an options object with two properties: \u2018el\u2019: specifies the DOM element that the Vue instance should be mounted to.\n\u2018data\u2019: specifies the data object that contains the application's state. \u2018el\u2019: specifies the DOM element that the Vue instance should be mounted to. \u2018 \u2018 el\u2019: \u2018data\u2019: specifies the data object that contains the application's state. \u2018data\u2019: Once the Vue instance is created, it will take over the specified DOM element and replace its contents with the template and data bindings defined in the Vue instance.",

        "answer": "In Vue.js, a component is a reusable and modular piece of code that encapsulates the template, style, and behaviour of a particular feature or UI element in the application. A component can be composed of other components and can communicate with other components through props and events. To create a component in \u2018Vue.js\u2019, we can use the \u2018Vue.component()\u2019 method or define it as an object with a template, data, props, methods, computed, watch and other options. \u2018Vue.js\u2019 \u2018Vue.component()\u2019 Consider the below code to understand this: Vue.component('my-component', {\n  template: '<div>{{ message }}</div>',\n  data: function () {\n    return {\n      message: 'Hello from my component!'\n    }\n  }\n}) Vue.component('my-component', {\n  template: '<div>{{ message }}</div>',\n  data: function () {\n    return {\n      message: 'Hello from my component!'\n    }\n  }\n}) In this example, we define a component called \u2018my-component\u2019 and specify its template and data options. The template option defines the HTML markup that should be rendered when the component is used, and the data option defines the initial state of the component's data. \u2018my-component\u2019 To use this component, we can reference the component tag name at the place where we want to use it.

        "question": "6. What is Virtual Dom in Vue.js?",
        "answer": "The Virtual DOM (VDOM) in Vue.js is a lightweight in-memory representation of the actual Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page. When a Vue.js component is created or updated, it creates a VDOM representation of its current state, which is then compared to the previous VDOM representation to determine the minimum set of changes that need to be made to the actual DOM to reflect the updated state. The VDOM is used as an optimization technique to minimize the number of direct manipulations of the DOM, which can be expensive in terms of performance. Instead of updating the actual DOM every time a component's state changes, Vue.js uses the VDOM to calculate the most efficient way to update the DOM and then applies those changes in a batched manner. This can result in significant performance improvements, particularly in large and complex applications.",

It allows us to establish a connection between the data and the UI, so that any changes to the data are automatically reflected in the UI, and any changes to the UI are automatically reflected in the data. There are three types of data binding in Vue.js: Interpolation: This is a one-way binding that allows us to embed the value of a data property into the content of an HTML element. It is denoted by double curly braces \u2018{{ }}\u2019. For example, \u2018{{ message }}\u2019 would bind the value of the message data property to the content of the HTML element.\nProperty binding: This is a one-way binding that allows us to set the value of an HTML element's attribute to the value of a data property. It is denoted by the \u2018v-bind\u2019 directive. For example, (v-bind:href=\"url\") would bind the value of the \u2018url\u2019 data property to the \u2018href\u2019 attribute of an HTML element.\nTwo-way binding: This allows us to bind the value of a form input element to a data property, so that changes to the input elements are reflected in the data, and vice versa.

To use the reverse filter in a template expression, we can simply pipe the message property through the filter using the \u2018|\u2019 character.

        "question": "14. What is a template in Vue.js? How does it differ from regular HTML?",
        "answer": "A template is a piece of HTML that defines the structure and layout of a component in a Vue.js application. These are very similar to regular HTML code, but they also include Vue-specific syntax and directives. This allows binding data to the user interface, handling user input, and conditionally rendering content based on data and user interactions. There are differences between a Vue.js template and regular HTML. The differences are - Vue-specific syntax: Templates include special syntax and directives. This allows binding data to the user interface and performing other dynamic operations. For example - We can use double curly braces ({{ }}) to output data values. Also, we can use v-bind to bind HTML attributes to data properties.\nReactivity: Templates are reactive. It means that the template can automatically update in response for changing in data and user interactions. When the data changes in a Vue.js application, the corresponding templates are automatically re-renders to reflect the new state of the application.\nDirectives: Vue.js templates include several built-in directives that allow us to perform complex operations. For Example - We can render data values conditionally using (v-if, v-else, v-show), we can easily loop over arrays and objects using (v-for), and handle user input using (v-on).\nComponents: Templates in vue.js can also be used to define the components. Components can be reused and can compose UI elements that can be utilized in the entire application. Components are defined using a combination of a template, script, and style, and can be nested inside other components to create complex UI structures.

This contains a piece of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code and is encapsulated into a single function and shares this code across different parts of the application. By using components, we can avoid code duplication, And we can reuse the component as many times as it is required in the application. In vue.js, components are of two types - Global components - Global components are defined at the top and can be used anywhere in the application. Mostly, we define global components in the main.js file or in a separate file and then import them into the application. We can register global components using the Vue.component() method.

        "answer": "Throughout their lifecycle, components experience numerous stages, where both created and mounted hooks function as tools to execute relevant actions. Although there is some difference between them. Those are - When a component is made, the \"created\" hook is instantly called and provides access to the component's data for tweaking. This hook can be utilized for organizational tasks such as configuring methods, data, and events that are necessary for the overall functionality of the component \"created\" As soon as the component's template has been compiled, rendered, and inserted into the Document Object Model (DOM), the \"Mounted\" hook comes into action. This hook is essential for executing any tasks that require the usage of DOM. This could involve setting up event listeners or kickstarting third-party libraries. \"Mounted\" Conclusion Vue.js is a popular JavaScript framework that is widely used for building complex, dynamic web applications.

Watchers are a key part of Vue.js's reactivity system, which automatically triggers the event and updates the view when data changes. Watchers are particularly useful when we need to perform some action in response to changes in data that cannot be accomplished with computed properties or methods.

        "answer": "Authentication and authorization are critical aspects of web application development, and Vue.js provides several approaches to handle them. Some commonly used methods are: Authentication: To handle authentication in a Vue.js application, we can use an authentication library like JWT or OAuth2.0. Once the user logs in, the authentication library will generate a token that you can store in the browser's local storage or cookies. We can then include this token in all subsequent requests to the server to verify the user's identity.\nFor example - we can use the vue-authenticate library to implement OAuth2.0 authentication in the Vue.js application. Once the user logs in using their credentials, the library will retrieve an access token that we can use to authenticate subsequent requests.\nAuthorization: To handle authorization in a Vue.js application, we can implement role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC). With RBAC, we can define the roles that correspond to different levels of access, and we assign these roles to users. With ABAC, we can define policies that specify which users are authorized to perform specific actions.\nFor example - we can use the vue-acl library to implement RBAC in the Vue.js application. This library provides a middleware that we can use to restrict access to specific routes or components based on the user's role.

        "answer": "There are several ways to handle errors in vue.js depending on the context and the type of error. Here are some common approaches: Error Handling in Components: Error Handling in Components: Error Handling in Components: To handle errors in Vue components, we can use the try-catch block. If an error occurs in the component, it will be caught by the catch block, and you can take appropriate action to handle the error. try-catch block For example, you can display an error message to the user, log the error, or even send it to a server for further analysis. Consider the below example code. For example <template>\n  <div>\n    <button @click=\"handleClick\">Click Me</button>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  methods: {\n    handleClick() {\n      try {\n        // Code that may cause an error\n      } catch (error) {\n        // Handle the error\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n</script> <template>\n  <div>\n    <button @click=\"handleClick\">Click Me</button>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  methods: {\n    handleClick() {\n      try {\n        // Code that may cause an error\n      } catch (error) {\n        // Handle the error\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n</script> Global Error Handling: Global Error Handling: Global Error Handling: To handle errors globally, we can use the errorHandler property of the Vue configuration object. This allows us to catch and handle errors that occur anywhere in your application. Consider the below example code to understand better. errorHandler import Vue from 'vue'\nVue.config.errorHandler = function (error, vm, info) {\n  // Handle the error\n} import Vue from 'vue'\nVue.config.errorHandler = function (error, vm, info) {\n  // Handle the error\n} Error Handling in Promises: Error Handling in Promises: Error Handling in Promises: For using the Promises in the Vue.js application, we can use the catch method to handle errors that occur during asynchronous operations. Consider the below example code that demonstrates how we can use it. this.$http.get('/api/data')\n  .then(response => {\n    // Handle the response\n  })\n  .catch(error => {\n    // Handle the error\n  }) this.$http.get('/api/data')\n  .then(response => {\n    // Handle the response\n  })\n  .catch(error => {\n    // Handle the error\n  })",

        "answer": "Optimizing the performance of a large Vue.js application requires several solutions that address different areas of the application. Although adopting specific optimization procedures, combining techniques has proven to deliver the highest return. Consider the following strategies: - Lazy Loading: Instead of loading everything at once, we can divide the application into smaller chunks and load them on demand using lazy loading. This split-up approach can significantly reduce initial load time and enhance overall application performance.\nCode Splitting: We can split the code into smaller chunks. And can load only the required component. Using this we can reduce the size of the application and can improve its performance.\nMinification and Compression: We can squeeze the app size and use the minified version of Javascript and CSS files (like jquery.min-js). This speeds up downloads and boosts performance.\nCaching: We can cache stuff like pics, fonts, and API responses so we don't put the load on the network as much and make our app run faster.\nUse Vuex for State Management: Vue.js provides Vuex (a state management library). This allows management of the state of the application in a centralized store. Using Vuex, we can cut down the number of API calls and make our Vue.js application faster.\nUse Async Components: Async components allows to load of components on demand. So using this we can reduce the unnecessary calls/request of components at the initial time.\nOptimize Vue.js Directives: We can use v-if instead of v-show for conditionally rendering elements. Also, we can use v-for with the key attribute, and use v-cloak to hide uncompiled Vue.js templates.\nServer-Side Rendering: Using Server-Side-Rendering, we can preload some of the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. This can improve performance in terms of SEO.\nUse Performance Analysis Tools:  There are various performance analysis tools that we can use like - Google Chrome Developer tools, Vue.js Developer tools, etc. This helps in debugging the complexity so that we can reduce it and optimize the performance.

        "answer": "Server-side rendering (SSR) is a web dev trick that involves generating HTML content on the server and shipping it off to the client as a fully-formed HTML page. Vue.js backs up SSR and can be used along with client-side rendering to whip up all-purpose apps. Server-side rendering (SSR) In the rendering on the client side, the browser snags the basic webpage codes and designs and kicks off the page view on the user side. And when the user fiddles with the page, the side handled by the user reaches out to get fresh data from the server and tweaks the core HTML tags as per the requirements. Going this way has advantages - like cracking open the page in a dash, making some great interactive changes, and making the job of coders a whole lot easier.  Yet, it also has disadvantages - like when it comes to SEO, there are going to be some issues, and the page's time-to-content is going to drag a bit.\nOn the other side, SSR does the HTML content baking on the server end and sends it out to the client as a full HTML page. It takes more time for the page to first show up, but once it does, it's already functioning perfectly. Besides that, SSR has some advantages over-client-side renderings like better search engine optimization, quicker content loading time, and more stable performance on weak devices.
