        "question": "1. What are the essential features of Sitecore?",
        "answer": "In order to help you better understand the benefits of Sitecore, here are some of the platform key features: Personalized Customer Data: Everything about customers, from their interactions to behaviours to data, is tracked and stored in order to provide insights to help the team deepen engagement and increase revenue.\nSitecore Experience Database (xDB): By integrating all of your customer experience data (including data from CRM and non-Sitecore-based systems), the Sitecore xDB creates a single store for the entire experience. Finally, you can see the entire journey of every individual customer all in one place (single repository).\nSitecore Experience Profile (xP): When xDB collects customer experience data, Sitecore XP creates an individual profile of each customer. The information in these profiles will help you to better understand your customers, such as what products they buy, what they click on, and how long they spend on your website.\nMulti-language and Multi-Site Content Support: Expanding globally brings many challenges, but delivering a consistent brand experience to new customers and employees is among the most crucial. Sitecore provides multilingual support to help you reduce your time-to-market and stay competitive, wherever you are. \nMarketing automation: Marketers can easily build automation campaigns that deliver real-time, automated responses in response to the actions visitors take on a site. For example, when a customer completes a purchase, an automated response email expressing appreciation for the purchase is sent.\nSitecore Federated Experience Manager (FXM): Wouldn't it be great if you didn't have to switch all your websites to Sitecore? Sitecore FXM lets you extend certain Sitecore features to non-Sitecore sites, ensuring that your customers have a seamless, positive experience across all of your websites (and ensuring accurate customer data is captured).

SXA basically separates structure and design, which enables frontend/backend developers, content authors, and creative designers to work simultaneously, and you can deploy and maintain multiple sites efficiently and cost-effectively. After the user experience plan has been developed, everyone can get started on the platform. As an example: while the front-end developer is working on the theme, the content author enters content into the wireframe environment. Meanwhile, the developer sets up the data templates. front-end developer front-end developer  ",

        "question": "5. Explain how to implement Sitecore.",
        "answer": "Sitecore CMS is based on .NET technology. Comparatively, Sitecore is better than a large number of other .NET-based platforms, such as OpenText or Sharepoint. Like any software implementation,  Sitecore implementation can also be time-consuming and expensive. However, it doesn't have to be complex. The following are some key points as part of the implementation process. Identify Implementation Type: A CMS implementation may involve a complete redesign or maybe more of a re-platforming. It is beneficial to meet with your stakeholders before implementing to determine what is best for your business.\nPrepare Implementation Document: As every Sitecore implementation is unique, you should create an architecture document that outlines your requirements and provides stakeholders with an overview of the project. This will prevent any unpleasant surprises in the future.\nSet up a timeline: If you want your Sitecore implementation to succeed, you need to set a timeline.  This will give you a rough estimate of how long the project will take and will also help you plan for any downtime that may occur.\nOutline Expectations: Together with a timeline, you can outline what to expect during the implementation process. Using a CMS like Sitecore won't instantly solve all of your business's problems and it also doesn't mean you can use all of its features. The most valuable thing you can do when you start is to know what to expect and what limitations you might face.\nBe aware of Costs: Costs can be high when implementing Sitecore. It is essential that you have a clear understanding of the project costs as well as the features and functions that are most important to your business.\nImplementation Process: Finally, your implementation partner will walk you through the entire implementation process. In addition to the timeline and costs, any additional resources and personnel required will also be considered. In addition, it will outline the steps that will be taken by teams working together and which project management style will be used to implement the changes, either waterfall or agile, or any other.

        "question": "6. Explain standard values in Sitecore.",
        "answer": "Data template fields have default values known as Standard Values. In Sitecore, a standard value is a way to specify a default value for a field, so that whenever items are created, it is possible to specify a field value that must be used by default. The standard values associated with each data template are stored in a child item of the data template definition item called \"Standard Values\". Whenever the value of a field for an item is NULL, standard values are used.   As you can see in the above image, the \"Sample item\" data template basically contains the \"Data\" data template section definition item. The standard value of the \"Sample\" data template is stored as a child of the \"Data\" data template definition item named \"_Standard Values.\"",

        "answer": "AEM (Adobe Experience Manager) and Sitecore are two of the most popular enterprise-level CMS (Content management systems). Below are some key differences between Sitecore and AEM that will help you determine which is best for your business. Adobe Experience Manager Adobe Experience Manager AEM vs Sitecore: AEM vs Sitecore:   AEM Sitecore\nWith 9 different product offerings, AEM has separated several marketing features like analytics and campaigns into separate \"products\" for purchase. This is great for those who just need one feature, for example, Adobe Analytics, but if you want the full marketing package from Adobe, you have to buy those features separately rather than as part of one package. There are four different products offered by Sitecore under the \"Sitecore Experience Cloud\". Only offering four platforms is wonderful because it packages up features so that they do not need to be acquired separately, and it also saves time and resources in configuring all the platforms to work together.\nWith Adobe having acquired a number of different systems, Adobe Experience Cloud is comprised of different languages and databases. From a development standpoint, this is challenging since developers are likely to encounter issues while trying to build across multiple platforms and languages. Development for Adobe can therefore be more time consuming, costly, and complex. All of Sitecore's products are built on top of the ASP.NET framework.  It is easier, flexible,  and more cost-effective to develop on Sitecore, and having .NET expertise is sufficient to develop across all platforms.\nAdobe's community and partner network are significantly less developed than Sitecore's and do not actively encourage community participation.  As a result of its active and large partner network, Sitecore users are rewarded for their contributions to the Sitecore community through incentives and discounts.

Modifying or changing an item automatically adds it to the publishing queue. This method of publishing is faster since Sitecore does not utilize resources to compare different versions of items in the publishing queue before publishing them.\nSmart Publish: In this publication, all items that have changed since the last publication are published. A Smart publish compares each item in the master database with its equivalent item in the target database, and if there have been any changes, the item gets published. This involves comparing all items in the database, which is a time-consuming process for publishing an entire website, particularly if there are many items in the content tree.\nRepublish: Everything is published there. Every item in the target database is overwritten by the equivalent item in the Master database, even if the item has not changed. By republishing, all obsolete versions are deleted from the target database. It can be used to bring an entirely new web database online, restore a backup of the master database, and add new content languages, publishing targets, and other system elements to the website.

This will require a rule-based processing model, which most people dislike due to its obvious complexity upon first use. At first, it might seem daunting, but it is a wise investment.
