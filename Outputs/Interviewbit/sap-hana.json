        "answer": "A familiar term to all, SAP S/4HANA is an application developed to operate on the SAP HANA in-memory database platform. It was released in 2015, SAP S/4HANA is SAP\u2019s most recent ERP (enterprise resource planning) and business intelligence offering, it uses technologies like machine learning, Artificial Intelligence, and cutting-edge analytics to simplify business processes. From enhancing production planning in manufacturing to streamlining accounting processes in finance, SAP S/4HANA can change organizations\u2019 business processes via smart automation. It can keep track and handle business resources, including products, and handle business commitments, like payrolls and purchase orders. For example, in the case of retailers, it can deliver real-time stock availability to consumers, assist with more practical and efficient supply-chain management, and utilize predictive analytics to recognize and control delivery delays. SAP S/4HANA is the 4th version of SAP Business Suite and is developed to be more user-friendly than the previous versions. It can also easily resolve more complicated problems and handle much more data. Though SAP S/4HANA is cloud-native, it is not restricted to operating on the cloud. It has versatile ways of deployment, like via public, private, or hybrid cloud and on-premise.",

        "question": "2. Describe the SAP HANA origins.",
        "answer": "Commenced in the year 2006, SAP HANA was developed by SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner during the time he was a computer science professor posted at the Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam, Germany. The plan was to design a database that could work with a near-zero response time for the purpose of transactional and analytical data processing. Plattner desired a system that could respond to any potential business question in real-time. After many years of development at SAP, in October 2010, a prerelease edition of SAP HANA was presented to chosen clients. The first version of SAP, SAP HANA 1.0, was released on June 18, 2011. SAP designed a cloud platform-as-a-service equipped with built-in support for SAP HANA in 2012. Later it renamed its Java-based server SAP NetWeaver Cloud to SAP HANA Cloud Platform (It changed its name in 2017 to SAP Cloud Platform and 2021 to SAP Business Technology Platform again). In 2013, SAP presented SAP HANA XS, a light app server implanted within SAP HANA that permitted application development. In 2015, SAP declared a successor for the ERP ECC it had created in 1992. The new solution was to be anointed SAP S/4HANA and would possess numerous factors of existing ERP processes under one umbrella. Underpinning the latest solution? SAP HANA.  ",

Also, SAP HANA\u2019s inbuilt machine learning and cutting-edge analytic abilities permit you to include unstructured data, such as predictive, text, spatial, event streams, and time series, enabling your business to arrive at better decisions.\nGain Real-Time Analytics: The in-memory technology of HANA dramatically decreases the time it takes to derive the most comprehensive reports. With HANA's accelerated business intelligence functionalities, you will be able to process data in near real-time, helping you make business decisions much more decisively.\nScalability: SAP HANA utilizes dynamic tiering, which indicates that data that\u2019s operated repeatedly stays in memory whereas less-used data shifts to disk when there is less space. Not only is this an incredibly economical way to handle large data volumes, but when you take HANA\u2019s state-of-the-art compression and columnar storage into consideration, it can cause a data footprint decline of anywhere from 3 to 5 times.\nSingle Source of Truth: A considerably simple advantage of SAP HANA is that it provides you with the capability to minimize your data silos by combining transactional and analytical data on a single solution. One source of truth allows us to discard errors, reduplication of data, and a lot of additional issues that take time and energy to fix.\nFlexibility and Versatility: One of the most multi-faceted data solutions, you can deploy SAP HANA in a public or private cloud, in numerous clouds, or in a hybrid scenario.

        "question": "8. What are the shortcomings of shifting to SAP HANA?",
        "answer": "Now that you have checked the advantages of SAP HANA, you might be more confident to execute the migration. Nonetheless, before choosing to make the transition, you also have to be mindful of the shortcomings you\u2019ll encounter during the process. Here are some of the disadvantages you should be cautious about while shifting to SAP HANA: Planning: Pain Points: Many companies fail to recognize the actual problems of their existing database infrastructure. Therefore, they miss the scope of the project. This results in wasted endeavours and resources. Without a concrete project goal and precise estimation of project expense, you will not have an accurate roadmap to digital transformation, thus it can negatively affect your Return on Investment (ROI).\nTechnical Issue: Code Conversion: Other shortcomings emerge from the technical aspect of the migration. If your system is still operating with a non-Unicode language, then it can cause a major challenge to migrate to SAP HANA. SAP HANA only backs the Unicode system, so most of the new SAP NetWeaver technology and SAP applications will be available only in Unicode. Thus, the requirement for Unicode system conversion has to be executed mindfully before moving to SAP HANA. Many companies are not aware of this knowledge of conversion, as a result, leads to system failures and waste.\nExecution: Downtime: Like in any other migration project, it all begins with an initial migration in the sandbox for the purpose of testing. Post which, the migration moves to Development and Quality before eventually advancing into Production. The primary problem when shifting to Production is the downtime as the consumers cannot access the system during this process. There might be a greater possibility of system failures during the migration if you do not pre-test the new database system comprehensively. It would lead to more significant downtime or worse, failures would be detected too late, leading to even lengthier outages.

        "question": "9. If the tables of a schema are implemented to create modeling views then why is it essential to grant SELECT privilege to user _SYS_REPO?",
        "answer": "If tables of a schema for example SCHEMA_ABC are implemented to create the modelling views, then the following SQL statement must be performed before starting any such modelling views. GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA SCHEMA_ABC TO _SYS_REPO with the option of GRANT\nConsider _SYS_REPO as \u201cthe activation guy\u201d. It takes your models and makes the required runtime objects from them. Thus user _SYS_REPO requires the allowance to choose YOUR tables/views. (If _SYS_REPO user is unable to decide on the tables added in the from-clause of the view-definition, it will fail to describe that view). If different customers require to choose this view (It is quite obvious this is always the scenario, else the views would not make any sense), then _SYS_REPO ought to have the extra allowance to grant the selection further (with the grant option).  After all your models that access data in your schemas has been activated, _SYS_REPO wants to offer you and other users read access to the activated models.",

Companies describe hierarchies for classification of information, letting roll-up and drill-down analysis. For instance, a sales company might assign a salesperson to a country and a country is assigned to a region. Then the sales data can be calculated and scrutinized by region, country, or salesperson. There are two kinds of hierarchies: Level Hierarchies are rigid hierarchies, where you can access the root and the child nodes in the defined order. For instance, organizational structures.\nParent/Child Hierarchies are regarded as value hierarchies, i.e, hierarchies obtained from the value of a node. Such as a Bill of Materials (BOM) includes Assembly and Part hierarchies, and an Employee Master record includes Employee and Manager data. The hierarchy can be analyzed on the basis of a selected parent, also, there are scenarios where the child can be a parent.
