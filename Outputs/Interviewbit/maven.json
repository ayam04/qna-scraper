        "question": "2. Discuss the core concepts of Maven.",
        "answer": "The core concepts of Maven are: POM Files: Project Object Model (POM) files are XML files that include information about the project and configuration information used by Maven to construct the project, such as dependencies, source directory, plugin, goals, and so on. When you want to run a maven command, you provide it with a POM file to run. To complete its configuration and functions, Maven reads the pom.xml file.\nDependencies and Repositories: Repositories are folders containing bundled JAR files, and dependencies are external Java libraries necessary for Project. The local repository is simply a folder on your computer's hard drive. Maven retrieves dependencies from a central Maven repository and places them in your local repository if they aren't found in the local Maven repository.\nBuild Life Cycles, Phases, and Goals: A build life cycle is made up of a series of build phases, each of which contains a set of goals. A build lifecycle, phase, or goal is referred to as a Maven command. When a lifecycle is asked to be run using the maven command, all of the build steps in that life cycle are likewise run. When a build phase is requested to be executed, it is followed by all build phases in the given sequence.\nBuild Profiles: Build Profiles are a set of configuration parameters that allow you to build your project using a variety of setups. For example, you might need to develop and test your project on your local computer. You can add different build profiles to your POM files using its profile elements to enable different builds, which can be triggered in a variety of ways.\nBuild Plugins: Build Plugins are used to accomplish a certain task. A plugin can be added to the POM file. Maven comes with various pre-installed plugins, but you can also write your own in Java.

        "question": "8. What is the use of an Optional Dependency?",
        "answer": "When splitting a project into submodules isn't practicable (for some reason), optional dependencies are employed. The concept is that some of the dependencies are just required for particular project features and will not be required if those features are not used. Such a feature should ideally be divided into a sub-module that is dependent on the project's main functionality. Only non-optional dependencies would be included in this new subproject, as you'd need them all if you wanted to use the subproject's features. If a user wants to use functionality associated with an optional dependency, they must redeclare it in their own project. Optional dependencies save storage and memory. They prevent troublesome jars from being packed into a WAR, EAR, fat jar, or other formats if they violate a license agreement or cause classpath difficulties.",

        "question": "9. What do you understand about \u2018Transitive Dependency\u2019 in Maven? What is dependency exclusion?",
        "answer": "By incorporating transitive dependencies automatically, Maven eliminates the need to discover and define libraries that the dependencies require. According to transitive dependency, if X is dependent on Y and Y is dependent on Z, then X is dependent on both Y and Z. The \"exclusion\" element can be used to exclude any transitive dependency. If X is reliant on Y and Y is reliant on Z, then X can declare Z as excluded.",

        "answer": "The Maven software relies heavily on external dependencies. It is an intrinsic component of the system without which it is impossible to find dependencies in a system. We'll need the following information to specify the external dependency: It necessitates a group ID that is identical to the library name.\nIt necessitates an artifact ID that is identical to the library name.\nThe system's dependency scope must be mentioned.\nThe system path that corresponds to the project position must be mentioned.

        "question": "11. What are user-defined properties?",
        "answer": "You have the opportunity to define your own arbitrary properties in addition to the implicit properties. A POM or a Profile can be used to define properties. The properties defined in a POM or a Maven Profile can be referenced in Maven just like any other property. User-defined properties can be used to filter resources via the Maven Resource plugin, or they can be referenced in a POM. In a Maven POM, here's an example of defining some arbitrary properties. <project>\n   ...\n   <properties>\n       <arbitrary.property.x>Text</arbitrary.property.x>\n       <hibernate.version>3.2.1.ga</hibernate.version>\n   </properties>\n   ...\n   <dependencies>\n       <dependency>\n           <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>\n           <artifactId>hibernate</artifactId>\n           <version>${hibernate.version}</version>\n       </dependency>\n   </dependencies>\n   ...\n</project> <project>\n   ...\n   <properties>\n       <arbitrary.property.x>Text</arbitrary.property.x>\n       <hibernate.version>3.2.1.ga</hibernate.version>\n   </properties>\n   ...\n   <dependencies>\n       <dependency>\n           <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>\n           <artifactId>hibernate</artifactId>\n           <version>${hibernate.version}</version>\n       </dependency>\n   </dependencies>\n   ...\n</project> arbitrary.property.x and hibernate.version are two properties defined in the preceding example. In a dependency declaration, hibernate.version is mentioned. It's usual practice in Maven POMs and Profiles to use the period character as a separator in property names. The following example demonstrates how to define a property in a Maven POM profile. <project>\n   ...\n   <profiles>\n       <profile>\n           <id>random-profile</id>\n           <properties>\n               <arbitrary.property>Text</arbitrary.property>\n           </properties>\n       </profile>\n   </profiles>\n   ...\n</project> <project>\n   ...\n   <profiles>\n       <profile>\n           <id>random-profile</id>\n           <properties>\n               <arbitrary.property>Text</arbitrary.property>\n           </properties>\n       </profile>\n   </profiles>\n   ...\n</project>",

        "question": "14. Why are exclusions made on a dependency-by-dependency basis instead of at the POM level?",
        "answer": "This is primarily to ensure that the dependency graph is predictable, as well as to prevent inheritance effects from eliminating a dependent that should not be excluded. If you have to use the method of last resort and add an exclusion, make sure you know which of your dependencies is causing the undesirable transitive dependency. The banned dependencies rule can be specified to fail the build if a troublesome dependency is identified, regardless of path. You'll need to add specific exclusions to each path the enforcer detects if the build fails.",

        "answer": "The default behavior includes merging the content of the configuration element according to the element name. If a certain element exists in the child POM, that value becomes the effective value. The parent value becomes the effective value if the child POM does not have an element but the parent does. It's important to note that this is solely an XML operation, with no code or plugin settings involved. Only the elements are involved, not their values. Advanced configuration inheritance includes adding attributes to the children of the configuration element to regulate how child POMs inherit configuration from parent POMs. Combine.children and combine.self are the two attributes. These attributes can be used in a child POM to regulate how Maven integrates the parent's plugin configuration with the child's explicit configuration.",

As a result, the parent project is aware of its modules, and if a Maven command is issued against the parent project, the Maven command is also applied to the parent's modules. For Project Aggregation, you must accomplish the following: Change the packaging of the parent POMs to \"pom.\"\nSpecify the modules' directories in the parent POM (children POMs).

Maven makes substantial use of Doxia, which powers the project's complete documentation system. It enables Maven to take any Doxia-supported document and output it in any format. For instance, 'mvn site' is the command used by Maven to produce javadocs for a specific project. Maven calls Doxia document generation and other report generating plugins when this command is run.",
