        "answer": "Types are logical categories or parts of an index whose semantics are determined by the user. Elasticsearch clusters can consist of multiple Indices (databases), each of which contains several Types (tables). A type holds multiple Documents (rows), and every document has some Properties (columns). By using types, multiple data types can be stored in the same index, thus reducing the total number of indices. Example: Example: Suppose, in your car manufacturing scenario, you had a Tatafactory index. There are three types (tables) in this index as follows: Cars\nPeople\nSpare_Parts Cars People Spare_Parts Every type then contains documents relevant to that type (e.g. a Tata Innova document is housed in the Cars type). In this document, you can find all the information about the particular car.",

        "answer": "ElasticSearch's advantages can be listed or summarized as follows: Elasticsearch is a fast search engine: Since Elasticsearch is built on top of Apache Lucene, it provides a full-text search. The latency between the time a document is indexed and the moment it can be searched is extremely short with ElasticSearch - typically one second. This makes Elasticsearch a good choice for time-sensitive use cases such as infrastructure monitoring and security analytics.\nElasticsearch is a distributed search engine: Elasticsearch stores or distributes documents across several containers called shards, which are duplicated to provide redundant copies of the data in the event of a hardware or system failure. Due to Elasticsearch's distributed nature, it can scale up to thousands of servers and can handle petabytes of data. You can use ElasticSearch as a replacement for document stores such as RavenDB and MongoDB.\nElasticsearch provides a wide range of features:  Aside from being scalable, fast, and resilient, Elasticsearch offers numerous built-in features like data roll-ups and index lifecycle management that make storing and searching data easier and more efficient.\nData ingestion, visualization, and reporting are simplified with the Elastic Stack or BELEK: Data can be collected and processed easily using Beats and Logstash before being indexed in Elasticsearch. Besides providing real-time visualization of Elasticsearch data, Kibana provides UIs for quick access to log files, application performance monitoring (APM), and infrastructure metrics data.

        "answer": "Shard: Elasticsearch crashes are often caused by large indexes. Due to the unlimited number of documents that can be stored on each index, an index may consume more disk space than the hosting server can provide. Indexing will begin to fail as soon as the index reaches this limit. As a solution to this problem, it is possible to divide or segment indexes horizontally into multiple pieces, also called shards. For an index, you can easily specify how many shards you want. As a result, every shard is its own, fully functional, and independent \"index\", which can run on any node in a cluster. Shard:   Replica: As the name implies, replicas are Elasticsearch fail-safe mechanisms, and are essentially copies of an index's shards. As a backup, this could come in handy when a node crashes. Furthermore, replicas can serve read requests, which is useful for increasing search performance. To ensure high availability, replicas must not be placed on the same node as the original shard (called the \"primary shared\") from which they were replicated. Replica:",

It is accomplished by sending a SIGTERM request to the process, which ends or terminates it. In order to initiate the shutdown process, you must first determine the process identifier (PID) for the Elasticsearch service you wish to terminate. Grep command can be used to locate processes easily. If you wish to locate all Elasticsearch-related processes running on a server, you can use the following command: ps -ef | grep elas ps -ef | grep elas After identifying the correct PID, simply execute a kill command with the PID of the Elasticsearch process.

        "question": "3. What is an Inverted index in ElasticSearch?",
        "answer": "ElasticSearch utilizes a hashmap-like data structure known as an inverted index that allows for rapid full-text searches. The inverted index lists all the unique words that appear in one or more documents and identifies all the documents those words appear in. With it, you can conduct quick searches across millions of documents to find relevant data. Example: Let's assume we have two different documents: Example: Scaler is a good Ed-tech company.\nInterviewBit is one of the good companies. Scaler is a good Ed-tech company. InterviewBit is one of the good companies. The above texts have been tokenized first into separate terms for indexing purposes. All the unique terms are then stored in the index, along with information such as which document the term appears in, its position, as well as how many times it appeared. Accordingly, the inverted index is as follows: Term Frequency Document Document: Position\nScaler 1 1 1:1\nis 2 1,2 1:2,2:2\na 1 1 1:3\ngood 2 1,2 1:4,2:6\nEd-tech 1 1 1:5\nCompany 1 1 1:6\nInterviewBit 1 2 2:1\none 1 2 2:3\nof  1 2 2:4\nthe 1 2 2:5\ncompanies 1 2 2:7 Term Frequency Document Document: Position\nScaler 1 1 1:1\nis 2 1,2 1:2,2:2\na 1 1 1:3\ngood 2 1,2 1:4,2:6\nEd-tech 1 1 1:5\nCompany 1 1 1:6\nInterviewBit 1 2 2:1\none 1 2 2:3\nof  1 2 2:4\nthe 1 2 2:5\ncompanies 1 2 2:7 Term Frequency Document Document: Position Term Frequency Document Document: Position Term Frequency Document Document: Position Scaler 1 1 1:1\nis 2 1,2 1:2,2:2\na 1 1 1:3\ngood 2 1,2 1:4,2:6\nEd-tech 1 1 1:5\nCompany 1 1 1:6\nInterviewBit 1 2 2:1\none 1 2 2:3\nof  1 2 2:4\nthe 1 2 2:5\ncompanies 1 2 2:7 Scaler 1 1 1:1 Scaler 1 1 1:1 is 2 1,2 1:2,2:2 is 2 1,2 1:2,2:2 a 1 1 1:3 a 1 1 1:3 good 2 1,2 1:4,2:6 good 2 1,2 1:4,2:6 Ed-tech 1 1 1:5 Ed-tech 1 1 1:5 Company 1 1 1:6 Company 1 1 1:6 InterviewBit 1 2 2:1 InterviewBit 1 2 2:1 one 1 2 2:3 one 1 2 2:3 of  1 2 2:4 of 1 2 2:4 the 1 2 2:5 the 1 2 2:5 companies 1 2 2:7 companies 1 2 2:7 Let's say you are looking for a term company or companies.

        "question": "10. Does ElasticSearch have a schema?",
        "answer": "Yes, it is possible for ElasticSearch to have a schema. The schema is a description of one or more fields in a document that describe what type of document it is and how different fields of a document are to be handled. In Elasticsearch, a schema describes the fields in JSON documents, their data types, and how they should be indexed in the Lucene indexes. As such, we call this schema a \"mapping\" in Elasticsearch.ch. But Elasticsearch can also be schema-less, meaning that documents can be indexed without the need to provide a schema explicitly.  If a mapping isn't specified, Elasticsearch will by default generate one when newly added fields are detected during indexing.",

        "question": "11. How can we perform a search in Elasticsearch?",
        "answer": "Below are a few ways to perform a search in Elasticsearch: Applying search API: You can search and aggregate data that is stored in Elasticsearch data streams and indices using the search API.\nSearch using a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier): The search request is executed using a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) by providing request parameters.\nRequest body search: The search request should be executed using DSL (Domain Specific Language) within the body.

        "question": "12. Explain Query DSL in ElasticSearch.",
        "answer": "Elasticsearch generally provides a query Domain Specific Language (DSL) based on JSON to define queries. Query DSL contains two kinds of clauses: Leaf query clause: A leaf query clause looks for specific values in a field or fields. They can be used independently. Matches, terms, and range queries are some examples of these queries.\nCompound query clause: A compound query clause is a combination of a leaf query and other compound queries. These queries combine multiple queries to produce their intended results. Leaf query clause: A leaf query clause looks for specific values in a field or fields. They can be used independently.

        "question": "13. What types of queries does ElasticSearch support?",
        "answer": "Elasticsearch supports a wide range of queries. The query begins with a query keyword, which is followed by conditions and filters in the form of a JSON object. Here are a few of the queries: Match All Query: This is a basic query that retrieves all the documents in the specified index.\nFull-text queries: There are high-level queries for executing full-text searches over full-text fields. Full-text queries usually work depending on the analyzer associated with a particular document or index. Full-text queries can be of different types, such as match query, multi-match query, query-string query, etc.\nTerm Level Queries: Instead of full-text field searches, term-level queries deal with structured data like numbers, enums, dates, etc. Term level queries can be of different types, such as range, exists, prefix, wildcard, fuzzy, type, etc. Match All Query: This is a basic query that retrieves all the documents in the specified index.
