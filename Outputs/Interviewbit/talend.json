        "question": "3. How do you handle schema changes in Talend?",
        "answer": "Handling schema changes in Talend can be done by following these steps: Updating the schema in the input component: When there are changes in the schema of the input data, like - adding or removing columns, then we need to update the schema in the input component to match the new schema.\nModifying the mapping in the tMap component: If the schema changes affect the mapping of data between different components, such as changing column names or data types, we need to modify the mapping in the tMap component to match the new schema.\nUpdating the schema in the output component: If the schema changes affect the output of the Job, such as changing the columns in the target database table, we need to update the schema in the output component to match the new schema.\nUsing dynamic schema: If the schema changes frequently or if the Job needs to handle different schemas at runtime, we can use a dynamic schema in Talend.
