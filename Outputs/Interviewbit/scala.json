        "answer": "A helper class, named App, is provided by Scala that provides the main method and its members together. App trait allows Objects to be turned into executable programs quickly. The App class in Scala can be extended instead of writing your own main method. This way you can produce concise and scalable applications. Example: Example: object InterviewBit extends App \n{  \nprintln(\"Hello Scala\")  \n} object InterviewBit extends App \n{  \nprintln(\"Hello Scala\")  \n} object InterviewBit extends App object InterviewBit extends App \"Hello Scala\"",

        "answer": "Streams, a Scala feature, are essentially lazy lists in which elements are only evaluated as needed. In this way, Scala allows for faster processing. Streams are similar to lists in terms of performance. Syntax: Syntax: val str = 1 #:: 2 #:: 3 #:: Stream.empty val str = 1 #:: 2 #:: 3 #:: Stream.empty val 1 2 3 Stream Scala lets you construct Lists by using the :: operator, while you can build Streams by using the #:: operator with Stream.empty at the end of the expression. A stream's head in the above syntax is 1, while its tail is 2 and 3. Example: Example: object MainObject \n{   \n    def main(args:Array[String]){   \n        val stream = 20 #:: 30 #:: 45 #:: Stream.empty   \n        println(stream)   \n    }   \n} object MainObject \n{   \n    def main(args:Array[String]){   \n        val stream = 20 #:: 30 #:: 45 #:: Stream.empty   \n        println(stream)   \n    }   \n} object MainObject object MainObject def main def main Array String val 20 30 45 Stream Output: Output: Stream(20, ?)

A tuple, however, can contain objects of different types, as well as being immutable. They are particularly useful when returning multiple values from methods. A tuple's type is determined by how many elements it contains as well as the type of those elements. Scala uses Tuple2, Tuple3, etc., up to Tuple22, to represent types of tuples. Scala currently limits the number of elements in a tuple to 22, and if the number of elements in the tuple exceeds 22, an error will be generated. Example: A tuple storing an integer, and a string. Example: val name = (23, \"InterviewBit\") val name = (23, \"InterviewBit\") val 23 \"InterviewBit\" The inferred type of ingredient is (Integer, String), which is shorthand for Tuple2[Int, String].

The interoperability of Scala and its functional programming paradigm propelled Scala's rapid growth. In order to address Java's critics, Scala is designed to be concise. The following are some of Scala's unique features that set it apart from other programming languages:   Type Inference: Scala doesn't require you to mention the data type or return type of functions explicitly. It will infer the type of data by itself and the return type of function depends on the type of last expression present in the function.\nImmutability: The default behavior of Scala variables is immutability, which means that they can't be altered. Thus, concurrency control can be managed easier. In addition, mutable variables can also be used.\nLazy Evaluation: In lazy evaluation or call-by-need, expressions are not evaluated until their first use, or until their demand. Computations are lazy in Scala by default. To declare a lazy variable, use the lazy keyword.\nCase classes and Pattern matching: Case classes in Scala are immutable classes that can be decomposed via pattern matching. Case classes include public and immutable parameters by default. These classes support pattern matching, which makes it easier to write logical code.\nString Interpolation: Scala 2.10.0 introduces String Interpolation, a new method for generating strings from your data. Users can embed variable references directly in processed string literals with string interpolation. String interpolation in Scala can be achieved using the s, f, and raw interpolation methods.\nSingleton object: Neither static variables nor static methods exist in Scala, so its singleton object (a class with only one object in the source code) is used as an entry point to your program execution. a class.

        "answer": "Despite being a simple topic, the monad belongs in the advanced section of the Scala language. It is important to understand that a monad is not a class or a trait; it is a concept. Thus, a monad represents an object that wraps another object in Scala. Each step in Monads has an output that serves as input for subsequent steps. Although Scala's maximum collections are Monads, yet not all Monads are collections. Some Monads, for example, can be used as containers like Options. To put it succinctly, the data types that implement map and flatMap() (such as options, lists) in Scala are called monads.",

Recursion involves breaking a problem down into smaller sub-problems and calling itself to resolve each of them. Simply put, recursion can be thought of as a function calling itself. Tail recursion refers to executing the last statement recursively.  As a result, these functions are more performant since they utilize tail call optimization. They do not add another stack frame to memory, but rather keep calling functions. If you are experiencing a stack overflow with your recursive functions, a tail-recursive function is your remedy. In addition, tail recursion makes your code faster and memory-constant.

Syntax: Syntax: list_Name :+ element_Name list_Name :+ element_Name Example: Example: object Colours  \n{ \n    def main(args: Array[String])  \n{ \n        val myList = List (\"Red\" , \"White\") \n        println(\"List\u2019s Content : \" + myList)         \n        println(\" Appending/adding elements at the end of list!\") \n        val updatedList = myList :+ \"Blue\" \n        println(\"Updated List\u2019s Content: \" + updatedList) \n    } \n} object Colours  \n{ \n    def main(args: Array[String])  \n{ \n        val myList = List (\"Red\" , \"White\") \n        println(\"List\u2019s Content : \" + myList)         \n        println(\" Appending/adding elements at the end of list!\") \n        val updatedList = myList :+ \"Blue\" \n        println(\"Updated List\u2019s Content: \" + updatedList) \n    } \n} object Colours object Colours def main def main Array String val List \"Red\" \"White\" \"List\u2019s Content : \" \" Appending/adding elements at the end of list!\" val \"Blue\" \"Updated List\u2019s Content: \" Output: Output: List\u2019s Content : List(Red, White)  \nAppending/adding elements at the end of the list! \nUpdated List\u2019s Content : List (Red, White, Blue) List\u2019s Content : List(Red, White)  \nAppending/adding elements at the end of the list! \nUpdated List\u2019s Content : List (Red, White, Blue) List Content List Red White Appending Updated List Content List Red White Blue",

        "question": "20. Explain higher-order functions with an example.",
        "answer": "Higher-order functions are functions in Scala that either take or return another function as an argument or parameter. Another way to say it is a function that works with a function. You can create higher-order functions, lambda functions, or anonymous functions using a higher-order function. Example: In this case, the apply function contains another function a that is applied to b. Example: object InterviewBit \n{ \n    def main(args: Array[String])  \n    { \n               println(apply(format, 45)) \n    } \n    def apply(a: Double => String, b: Double) = a(b) \n    def format[S](x: S) = \"{\" + x.toString() + \"}\" \n} object InterviewBit \n{ \n    def main(args: Array[String])  \n    { \n               println(apply(format, 45)) \n    } \n    def apply(a: Double => String, b: Double) = a(b) \n    def format[S](x: S) = \"{\" + x.toString() + \"}\" \n} object InterviewBit object InterviewBit def main def main Array String 45 def apply def apply Double String Double def format def format S S \"{\" \"}\" Output: Output: {45.0} {45.0} 45.0",

        "question": "21. What do you mean by Closure in Scala?",
        "answer": "Scala closures are functions whose return value is dependent on one or more free variables declared outside the closure function. Neither of these free variables is defined in the function nor is it used as a parameter, nor is it bound to a function with valid values. Based on the values of the most recent free variables, the closing function is evaluated. Syntax: Syntax: var x = 20   \ndef function_name(y:Int)    \n{ \nprintln(x+y) \n} var x = 20   \ndef function_name(y:Int)    \n{ \nprintln(x+y) \n} var 20 def function_name def function_name Int Example: Example: object InterviewBit \n{ \n    def main(args: Array[String]) \n    { \n        println( \"Sum(2) value = \" + sum(2)) \n        println( \"Sum(3) value = \" + sum(3)) \n        println( \"Sum(4) value = \" + sum(4)) \n    }    \n    var x = 20 \n    val sum = (y:Int) => y + x \n} object InterviewBit \n{ \n    def main(args: Array[String]) \n    { \n        println( \"Sum(2) value = \" + sum(2)) \n        println( \"Sum(3) value = \" + sum(3)) \n        println( \"Sum(4) value = \" + sum(4)) \n    }    \n    var x = 20 \n    val sum = (y:Int) => y + x \n} object InterviewBit object InterviewBit def main def main Array String \"Sum(2) value = \" 2 \"Sum(3) value = \" 3 \"Sum(4) value = \" 4 var 20 val Int Output: Output: Sum(2) value = 22 \nSum(3) value = 23 \nSum(4) value = 24 Sum(2) value = 22 \nSum(3) value = 23 \nSum(4) value = 24 Sum 2 22 Sum 3 23 Sum 4 24 In the above program, the sum is a closure function. var x = 20 is an impure closure.

        "question": "22. Explain Traits in Scala.",
        "answer": "The concept of traits is similar to an interface in Java, but they are even more powerful since they let you implement members. It is composed of both abstract and non-abstract methods, and it features a wide range of fields as its members. Traits can either contain all abstract methods or a mixture of abstract and non-abstract methods. In computing, a trait is defined as a unit that encapsulates the method and its variables or fields. Furthermore, Scala allows partial implementation of traits, but no constructor parameters may be included in traits. To create traits, use the trait keyword. Syntax: Syntax: trait Trait_Name \n{ \n   // Fields...  \n   // Methods... \n} trait Trait_Name \n{ \n   // Fields...  \n   // Methods... \n} trait Trait_Name trait Trait_Name // Fields... // Methods...
