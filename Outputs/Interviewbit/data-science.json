In other words, we can say that it is a measure of change in the weights with respect to the change in error. The gradient can be mathematically represented as the slope of a function. Gradient:   Gradient Descent: Gradient descent is a minimization algorithm that minimizes the Activation function. Well, it can minimize any function given to it but it is usually provided with the activation function only. Gradient Descent: Gradient descent, as the name suggests means descent or a decrease in something. The analogy of gradient descent is often taken as a person climbing down a hill/mountain. The following is the equation describing what gradient descent means: So, if a person is climbing down the hill, the next position that the climber has to come to is denoted by \u201cb\u201d in this equation. Then, there is a minus sign because it denotes the minimization (as gradient descent is a minimization algorithm). The Gamma is called a waiting factor and the remaining term which is the Gradient term itself shows the direction of the steepest descent. This situation can be represented in a graph as follows:   Here, we are somewhere at the \u201cInitial Weights\u201d and we want to reach the Global minimum.

Four types of selection bias are explained below: Sampling Bias: As a result of a population that is not random at all, some members of a population have fewer chances of getting included than others, resulting in a biased sample. This causes a systematic error known as sampling bias.\nTime interval: Trials may be stopped early if we reach any extreme value but if all variables are similar invariance, the variables with the highest variance have a higher chance of achieving the extreme value.\nData: It is when specific data is selected arbitrarily and the generally agreed criteria are not followed.\nAttrition: Attrition in this context means the loss of the participants.

        "question": "16. Define bias-variance trade-off?",
        "answer": "Let us first understand the meaning of bias and variance in detail: Bias: It is a kind of error in a machine learning model when an ML Algorithm is oversimplified. When a model is trained, at that time it makes simplified assumptions so that it can easily understand the target function. Some algorithms that have low bias are Decision Trees, SVM, etc. On the other hand, logistic and linear regression algorithms are the ones with a high bias. Bias: Variance: Variance is also a kind of error. It is introduced into an ML Model when an ML algorithm is made highly complex. This model also learns noise from the data set that is meant for training. It further performs badly on the test data set. This may lead to over lifting as well as high sensitivity. Variance: When the complexity of a model is increased, a reduction in the error is seen. This is caused by the lower bias in the model. But, this does not happen always till we reach a particular point called the optimal point. After this point, if we keep on increasing the complexity of the model, it will be over lifted and will suffer from the problem of high variance. We can represent this situation with the help of a graph as shown below:   As you can see from the image above, before the optimal point, increasing the complexity of the model reduces the error (bias). However, after the optimal point, we see that the increase in the complexity of the machine learning model increases the variance. Trade-off Of Bias And Variance: So, as we know that bias and variance, both are errors in machine learning models, it is very essential that any machine learning model has low variance as well as a low bias so that it can achieve good performance. Trade-off Of Bias And Variance: Let us see some examples. The K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm is a good example of an algorithm with low bias and high variance. This trade-off can easily be reversed by increasing the k value which in turn results in increasing the number of neighbours. This, in turn, results in increasing the bias and reducing the variance. K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm Another example can be the algorithm of a support vector machine. This algorithm also has a high variance and obviously, a low bias and we can reverse the trade-off by increasing the value of parameter C. Thus, increasing the C parameter increases the bias and decreases the variance. So, the trade-off is simple. If we increase the bias, the variance will decrease and vice versa.",

        "question": "17. Define the confusion matrix?",
        "answer": "It is a matrix that has 2 rows and 2 columns. It has 4 outputs that a binary classifier provides to it. It is used to derive various measures like specificity, error rate, accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and recall.   The test data set should contain the correct and predicted labels. The labels depend upon the performance. For instance, the predicted labels are the same if the binary classifier performs perfectly. Also, they match the part of observed labels in real-world scenarios. The four outcomes shown above in the confusion matrix mean the following: True Positive: This means that the positive prediction is correct.\nFalse Positive: This means that the positive prediction is incorrect.\nTrue Negative: This means that the negative prediction is correct.\nFalse Negative: This means that the negative prediction is incorrect. True Positive: This means that the positive prediction is correct. True Positive: False Positive: This means that the positive prediction is incorrect. False Positive: True Negative: This means that the negative prediction is correct. True Negative: False Negative: This means that the negative prediction is incorrect. False Negative: The formulas for calculating basic measures that comes from the confusion matrix are: Error rate: (FP + FN)/(P + N)\nAccuracy: (TP + TN)/(P + N)\nSensitivity = TP/P\nSpecificity = TN/N\nPrecision = TP/(TP + FP)\nF-Score  = (1 + b)(PREC.REC)/(b2 PREC + REC) Here, b is mostly 0.5 or 1 or 2.

Hence, we have various classification algorithms in machine learning like logistic regression, support vector machine, decision trees, Naive Bayes classifier, etc. One such classification technique that is near the top of the classification hierarchy is the random forest classifier. random forest So, firstly we need to understand a decision tree before we can understand the random forest classifier and its works. So, let us say that we have a string as given below:   So, we have the string with 5 ones and 4 zeroes and we want to classify the characters of this string using their features. These features are colour (red or green in this case) and whether the observation (i.e. character) is underlined or not. Now, let us say that we are only interested in red and underlined observations. So, the decision tree would look something like this:   So, we started with the colour first as we are only interested in the red observations and we separated the red and the green-coloured characters. After that, the \u201cNo\u201d branch i.e. the branch that had all the green coloured characters was not expanded further as we want only red-underlined characters. So, we expanded the \u201cYes\u201d branch and we again got a \u201cYes\u201d and a \u201cNo\u201d branch based on the fact whether the characters were underlined or not. So, this is how we draw a typical decision tree. However, the data in real life is not this clean but this was just to give an idea about the working of the decision trees. Let us now move to the random forest. Random Forest Random Forest It consists of a large number of decision trees that operate as an ensemble. Basically, each tree in the forest gives a class prediction and the one with the maximum number of votes becomes the prediction of our model. For instance, in the example shown below, 4 decision trees predict 1, and 2 predict 0. Hence, prediction 1 will be considered.   The underlying principle of a random forest is that several weak learners combine to form a keen learner. The steps to build a random forest are as follows: Build several decision trees on the samples of data and record their predictions.\nEach time a split is considered for a tree, choose a random sample of mm predictors as the split candidates out of all the pp predictors. This happens to every tree in the random forest.\nApply the rule of thumb i.e. at each split m = p\u221am = p.\nApply the predictions to the majority rule.

It is used to evaluate the data spread around the line of best fit. So, in simple words, it is used to measure the deviation of the residuals. RMSE: line of best RMSE is calculated using the formula:   Yi is the actual value of the output variable.\nY(Cap) is the predicted value and,\nN is the number of data points. Yi is the actual value of the output variable. Yi Y(Cap) is the predicted value and, Y(Cap) N is the number of data points. N MSE: Mean Squared Error is used to find how close is the line to the actual data. So, we make the difference in the distance of the data points from the line and the difference is squared.

        "question": "5. Explain Neural Network Fundamentals.",
        "answer": "In the human brain, different neurons are present. These neurons combine and perform various tasks. The Neural Network in deep learning tries to imitate human brain neurons. The neural network learns the patterns from the data and uses the knowledge that it gains from various patterns to predict the output for new data, without any human assistance. A perceptron is the simplest neural network that contains a single neuron that performs 2 functions. The first function is to perform the weighted sum of all the inputs and the second is an activation function.   There are some other neural networks that are more complicated. Such networks consist of the following three layers: Input Layer: The neural network has the input layer to receive the input.\nHidden Layer: There can be multiple hidden layers between the input layer and the output layer. The initially hidden layers are used for detecting the low-level patterns whereas the further layers are responsible for combining output from previous layers to find more patterns.\nOutput Layer: This layer outputs the prediction.

        "question": "6. What is Generative Adversarial Network?",
        "answer": "This approach can be understood with the famous example of the wine seller. Let us say that there is a wine seller who has his own shop. This wine seller purchases wine from the dealers who sell him the wine at a low cost so that he can sell the wine at a high cost to the customers. Now, let us say that the dealers whom he is purchasing the wine from, are selling him fake wine. They do this as the fake wine costs way less than the original wine and the fake and the real wine are indistinguishable to a normal consumer (customer in this case). The shop owner has some friends who are wine experts and he sends his wine to them every time before keeping the stock for sale in his shop. So, his friends, the wine experts, give him feedback that the wine is probably fake. Since the wine seller has been purchasing the wine for a long time from the same dealers, he wants to make sure that their feedback is right before he complains to the dealers about it. Now, let us say that the dealers also have got a tip from somewhere that the wine seller is suspicious of them. So, in this situation, the dealers will try their best to sell the fake wine whereas the wine seller will try his best to identify the fake wine. Let us see this with the help of a diagram shown below:   From the image above, it is clear that a noise vector is entering the generator (dealer) and he generates the fake wine and the discriminator has to distinguish between the fake wine and real wine. This is a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Generative Adversarial Network In a GAN, there are 2 main components viz. Generator and Discrminator. So, the generator is a CNN that keeps producing images and the discriminator tries to identify the real images from the fake ones.",

        "answer": "ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve is a graphical representation of the contrast between false-positive rates and true positive rates at different thresholds. The curve is used as a proxy for a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) The ROC curve is created by plotting values of true positive rates (TPR or sensitivity) against false-positive rates (FPR or (1-specificity)) TPR represents the proportion of observations correctly predicted as positive out of overall positive observations. The FPR represents the proportion of observations incorrectly predicted out of overall negative observations. Consider the example of medical testing, the TPR represents the rate at which people are correctly tested positive for a particular disease.  ",

MCC (Matthews correlation coefficient): AUC (Area Under the Curve): This represents a relation between the true positive rates and false-positive rates. AUC (Area Under the Curve): For example, consider the below graph that illustrates training data: Here, if we measure the accuracy of the model in terms of getting \"0\"s, then the accuracy of the model would be very high -> 99.9%, but the model does not guarantee any valuable information. In such cases, we can apply different evaluation metrics as stated above.   Training Set Resampling: It is also possible to balance data by working on getting different datasets and this can be achieved by resampling. There are two approaches followed under-sampling that is used based on the use case and the requirements:\nUnder-sampling This balances the data by reducing the size of the abundant class and is used when the data quantity is sufficient. By performing this, a new dataset that is balanced can be retrieved and this can be used for further modeling.\nOver-sampling This is used when data quantity is not sufficient. This method balances the dataset by trying to increase the samples size. Instead of getting rid of extra samples, new samples are generated and introduced by employing the methods of repetition, bootstrapping, etc.\nPerform K-fold cross-validation correctly: Cross-Validation needs to be applied properly while using over-sampling. The cross-validation should be done before over-sampling because if it is done later, then it would be like overfitting the model to get a specific result. To avoid this, resampling of data is done repeatedly with different ratios.

        "question": "1. How do I prepare for a data science interview?",
        "answer": "Some of the preparation tips for data science interviews are as follows: preparation tips Resume Building: Firstly, prepare your resume well. It is preferable if the resume is only a 1-page resume, especially for a fresher. You should give great thought to the format of the resume as it matters a lot. The data science interviews can be based more on the topics like linear and logistic regression, SVM, root cause analysis, random forest, etc. So, prepare well for the data science-specific questions like those discussed in this article, make sure your resume has a mention of such important topics and you have a good knowledge of them. Also, please make sure that your resume contains some Data Science-based Projects as well. It is always better to have a group project or internship experience in the field that you are interested to go for. However, personal projects will also have a good impact on the resume. So, your resume should contain at least 2-3 data science-based projects that show your skill and knowledge level in data science. Please do not write any such skill in your resume that you do not possess. If you are just familiar with some technology and have not studied it at an advanced level, you can mention a beginner tag for those skills.\nPrepare Well: Apart from the specific questions on data science, questions on Core subjects like Database Management systems (DBMS), Operating Systems (OS), Computer Networks(CN), and Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) can be asked from the freshers especially. So, prepare well for that as well.\nData structures and Algorithms are the basic building blocks of programming. So, you should be well versed with that as well.\nResearch the Company: This is the tip that most people miss and it is very important. If you are going for an interview with any company, read about the company before and especially in the case of data science, learn which libraries the company uses, what kind of models are they building, and so on. This gives you an edge over most other people. Resume Building: Firstly, prepare your resume well. It is preferable if the resume is only a 1-page resume, especially for a fresher.

        "question": "3. What are the top 3 technical skills of a data scientist?",
        "answer": "The top 3 skills of a data scientist are: Mathematics: Data science requires a lot of mathematics and a good data scientist is strong in it. It is not possible to become a good data scientist if you are weak in mathematics.\nMachine Learning and Deep Learning: A data scientist should be very skilled in Artificial Intelligence technologies like deep learning and machine learning. Some good projects and a lot of hands-on practice will help in achieving excellence in that field.\nProgramming: This is an obvious yet the most important skill. If a person is good at programming it does mean that he/she can solve complex problems as that is just a problem-solving skill. Programming is the ability to write clean and industry-understandable code. This is the skill that most freshers slack because of the lack of exposure to industry-level code. This also improves with practice and experience. Mathematics: Data science requires a lot of mathematics and a good data scientist is strong in it.
