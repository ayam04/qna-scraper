But, an Oracle DBA's primary responsibility is to administer the database, which covers areas such as doing maintenance to keep the databases operational, taking backups, maintaining privacy standards, and so on. DBAs are not typically tasked with writing code. DBAs, like developers, are expected to have a strong understanding of SQL and PL/SQL, as they are also essential for database administration.

If monthly reports are pending, the database administrator might automatically supply a dedicated server to that program to manage the growing demands.
