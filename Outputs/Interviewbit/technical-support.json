Method 4: Manually restore the registry Method 4: Manually restore the registry The defective registry can also be fixed by replacing it with a fresh copy created while Windows was being installed on the hard drive. This step will restore the system to a state that may differ significantly from its present state; nevertheless, user data will still be accessible. This technique should be avoided if the system has an OEM-installed operating system because the system registry hive upon OEM installations generates passwords and user accounts that did not even exist previously. To begin, create a backup of all existing registry files, which can be restored if anything goes wrong. The current registry is then deleted and replaced with a fresh one from the C:WindowsRepair folder. After the boot procedure is complete, you have the option of backing up all user data and reinstalling Windows from scratch or specifically restoring the system registry to a more current version supported by System Restore.
