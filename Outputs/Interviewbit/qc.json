        "answer": "Software quality control involves two phases, namely the reviewing and testing phase. Reviewing Phase: The review phase is a type of static testing or verification process aimed at preventing software defects. This is a process-oriented approach for enhancing the development process performed without executing programs. There are several review activities within the software development life cycle process, such as requirements, design, coding, test plan, test cases, and deployment. It is basically a process-level verification to prevent software defects.\nTesting Phase: Testing is a dynamic or validation process that identifies defects in a software application. This is a product-oriented approach to improving software product quality performed with program execution. There are several testing activities within the software development life cycle process, such as unit, integration, system, user acceptance, non-functional, release and maintenance testing. Furthermore, as part of this activity, we perform additional functional and non-functional testing, such as smoke testing, retesting, regression testing, sanity testing, as well as performance testing, load testing, volume testing, stress testing, endurance testing to improve the priority (importance of fixing the defect) and severity (impact of the defect) of the developed software product quality.
