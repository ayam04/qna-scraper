        "answer": "The encryption keys are not accessible to anyone. These keys are encrypted with the client's RSA public key and kept in the CommServe database. Depending on the settings, the client's RSA private key is encrypted with either a built-in passphrase or a passphrase provided by the user. The Pass Phrase entered by the user is not saved. These passphrases can only be set and changed by authorised users (as determined by user management). Passphrases are never written down in plain text.",

        "answer": "Software encryption is a CPU-intensive activity that can slow down your backup or supplemental copy by 40 per cent to 50 percent. This projected performance hit does not apply to deduplicated data because the deduplication process removes all duplicate data and only encrypts data blocks that are unique throughout the whole deduplication database. As a result, the performance impact of deduplicated data will be minimal.",

Servers can be restored using snapshots by restoring them to the state they were in when the snapshot was taken. Snapshot   The following points illustrate the differences between snapshot and backup: Backups can be kept in multiple places, on the same disk, or even on the same server. They don't necessitate both off- and on-site storage. Snapshots necessitate both on-site and off-site storage, and they must always be kept in the same locations as the original system data.\nBackups for SQL servers are normally done through a subscription service.

Snapshots also save time when copying data.\nOnly the file system is included in backup files. Different types of systems can be captured in snapshots. Files, programs, settings, and other items fall into this category.\nBackups are saved in various locations and can be readily recovered. Backups are frequently verifiable as well.

        "answer": "A snapshot is a \"picture\" of your server's file system taken at a certain point in time. In the event of data loss or corruption, this picture of your file system is frequently utilised to recover complete servers. When there isn't enough space, fresh snapshots will typically overwrite existing snapshots. Snapshots can come in handy in a variety of situations. The following are the advantages of having a snapshot: Snapshots are tiny and can be taken quickly and simply without causing too much server load.\nThey improve app availability, speed recovery, simplify backup administration for large data volumes, and reduce data loss risk.\nSnapshots can be scheduled and used for system backup as needed.\nThey can almost completely eliminate the requirement for backup windows while also lowering the total cost of ownership.\nSnapshots can be used to recover data that has been corrupted or destroyed. (In the event of file corruption, you can also roll back to an older version of a snapshot.)\nRather than restoring the entire system, replicated snapshot copies can be used because they are already in their natural format.\nYou can immediately begin restoring a server from a snapshot.

        "question": "13. What are the various types of transport modes that VMware supports?",
        "answer": "Storage Area Networks (SAN): The VMware Backup Host must be installed on a physical computer that has access to a Fibre Channel or iSCSI SAN that contains the virtual discs to be accessed. Because no data must be sent through the production ESX/ESXi host, this is an efficient data channel. In this mode, the vStorage APIs get information about the structure of VMFS LUNs from the vCenter server or the ESX/ESXi host and then read data directly from the SAN or iSCSI LUN where the VMDK is stored.\nLocal Area Network (LAN): The ESX/ESXi host reads data from storage and transmits it via a network to the VMware Backup Host in this mode. Unlike SAN transfer, this kind of transport does require a LAN. The following are some of the benefits of LAN transport:\nAny storage device, whether local storage or NAS, can be used by the ESX/ESXi host.\nBecause the VMware Backup server could be a virtual machine, you can use VMware vSphere's resource pool and scheduling capabilities to reduce the backup's performance impact. You can put the VMware Backup Host, for example, in a different resource pool than the production ESX/ESXi hosts, with a lower backup priority.\nIf the ESX/ESXi host and the VMware Backup Host are on the same private network, you can use unencrypted data transfer instead of NBDSSL, which is faster and uses fewer resources. You can transport virtual machine data in an encrypted form using NBDSSL if you need to protect sensitive information.\nHotAdd: When running VMware Backup Host on a Virtual Machine, vStorage APIs can use the ESX/ESXi server's SCSI Hot-add feature to attach the VMDKs of a backed-up Virtual Machine to the VMware Backup Host. It's simple to move a virtual machine around, and it can back up local storage without utilising the LAN, however, this has a higher burden on the physical ESX/ESXi host than using SAN transport mode.\nNetwork Attached Storage (NAS): The VSA proxy computer can read data directly from the network file server using NAS.

The flag is checked during an auxiliary copy operation, and if the data has already been encrypted, no additional software encryption is used. During the auxiliary copy procedure, only data that has not been encrypted by HDPS will be encrypted.",

        "question": "4. When writing to the media, can encryption have an effect on compression?",
        "answer": "Yes, data is effectively randomised when backup procedures are performed using encryption. This means that while compressing encrypted data, compression methods will be less effective. As a result, there will be a visible difference in the compression ratio when this data is written to the media. For example, a tape with a native capacity of 110GB that was formerly compressed to 190GB may now only be able to write 124GB to the same tape when encryption is used. The amount of data that can be written to tape depends on the type of data that is being written. Image files will not be compressed because they are already compressed, however, a TXT file will be compressed heavily.",

        "question": "5. Is a Certificate Authority required for encryption in Commvault?",
        "answer": "Only in the case of asymmetric cryptography, where distinct keys are used to encrypt (with the private key) and decrypt (with the public key), is a Certificate Authority required. There is no need for a certificate or a certificate authority because all of our encryption is symmetric (the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt). When exchanging data over insecure lines (such as the internet), and the identity of the entities on both ends is unknown, asymmetric crypto is employed. The CA helps validate the validity of the sent data, ensuring that malicious material is not sent. This issue does not exist in our situation because both endpoints have known entities.",

        "question": "6. What is the difference between a snapshot and a clone of a virtual machine?",
        "answer": "A snapshot copies the virtual machine's disk file to maintain its current state. It is used as a backup system. Create a snapshot if you need to save the configuration of a virtual machine so you can revert to it later if something goes wrong. A clone, on the other hand, is a complete copy of the virtual machine. Cloning is the sole option if you need to create a new virtual machine that will run on its own.",

        "question": "7. Explain the following terminologies in the context of Commvault: Storage Policy, Job Manager, Backup set, Subclient, Collect Files.",
        "answer": "Storage Policy: The storage policy determines where the data is saved and how long the snapshot will be kept. Copies can be found within a Storage Policy. In the IRM environment, these copies define retention for the designated storage devices. Within IRM, there are just two versions of interest. The Primary Snapshot Copy and the Primary Copy are two different copies of the same thing. The Primary Snapshot Copy merely specifies how long the snapshots will be kept and which MediaAgent will be cataloguing them. The Primary Copy specifies the location of the catalogued indexes.\nJob Manager: Displays all information about a running job, including data protection, recovery, and Auxiliary copy, as well as settings and media usage. Snapshot jobs can be launched, suspended, restarted, and cancelled by the Job Manager.\nBackup Set: A backup set is a sub-container present within each of these agents. The backup set is the client's overall container. The most straightforward approach to comprehending a backup set is to relate it to the context of the system being snapped in the environment. The backup set for the file system iDataAgent is the fundamental physical system storage environment, whereas the backup set for these two database agents is the Exchange Information Store or SQL instance. An overall vCenter is the backup set in a Virtual Context since it encompasses numerous ESX servers that house and manage virtual machines.\nSubclient: The smallest subset of a client is called a subclient. From the perspective of a Windows host, it may be a single folder, a single database, a single Virtual machine, or a single LUN or drive letter (regardless of how many LUNs are meta-LUN'ed to produce one huge LUN pool). Sub clients are backup set definitions that are related to Storage Policies, which define the snapshot data's retention and location.\nCollect Files: During an IntelliSnap job, Collect Files are smaller text files that will gather information on what is on each of the clone/snapshots. The original information lying on the snapshots is indexed by the collect files saved under the task result directory under each of the IRM clients when the snapshot is mounted to be catalogued. Once the cataloguing is complete, the information will be given immediately to the MediaAgent who will store it in indexes for a longer period of time. These indexes will remain on the MediaAgent for the duration of the snapshot's retention period, either in the local MediaAgent index cache or in the disc library set up to protect the indexes and the CommCell database backup.
