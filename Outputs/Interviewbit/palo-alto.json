        "answer": "Finding solutions and analysing malware to protect a network from potential attacks is a time-consuming procedure. Wildfire is a cloud-based malware detection service that aids in the detection of unknown files or threats created by attackers. Wildfire provides enterprises with immediate protection and danger intelligence. The WildFire Analysis Environment detects and blocks previously unknown malware by creating signatures that Palo Alto Networks firewalls can employ to detect and stop it. When a Palo Alto Networks firewall identifies an unknown sample (a file or a link included in an email), it can send the sample to WildFire for analysis. WildFire classifies a sample as benign, grayware, phishing, or malicious based on the traits, behaviours, and activities it exhibits when examined and performed in the WildFire sandbox. WildFire then creates signatures to recognise the freshly identified malware and makes the most recent signatures available globally in real-time for retrieval. The malware originally detected by a single Palo Alto Networks firewall can subsequently be automatically blocked by all Palo Alto Networks firewalls by comparing incoming samples against these signatures. From the time where a user downloads a file containing an advanced VM-aware payload until the point where WildFire develops a signature package utilised by Palo Alto Networks firewalls to protect against future malware exposure, the following sequence explains the WildFire process lifecycle.

        "question": "6. How does an APP-ID work?",
        "answer": "App-ID is used to identify applications on your network in the following way: Traffic is compared to policy to see if it is authorised on the network.\nThe application is then identified by applying signatures to approved traffic based on application traits and transaction characteristics that are unique to the application. The signature also determines whether or not the application is running on its default port. If the traffic is allowed by policy, it is checked for threats and studied further so that the application may be identified.\nIf App-ID detects encryption (SSL or SSH) and a Decryption policy rule is in place, the session is decrypted and application signatures are applied again to the decrypted flow.\nAdditional context-based signatures are applied to decoders for well-known protocols in order to detect other apps that may be tunnelling within the protocol (for example, Yahoo! Instant Messenger via HTTP). Decoders ensure that traffic follows protocol standards, and they make NAT traversal and dynamic pinhole opening easier for applications like SIP and FTP.\nHeuristics or behavioural analysis may be used to establish the identity of apps that are exceptionally evasive and cannot be identified by advanced signature and protocol analysis.

        "question": "10. What are the different failover scenarios?",
        "answer": "The event is known as a failover when one firewall fails and the peer takes over the role of safeguarding traffic. When a monitored metric on a firewall in the HA pair fails, for example, a failover is initiated. The scenarios that explain the failure over triggering are as follows: Hello messages and heartbeat polling:\nHello messages and heartbeats are used by the firewalls to ensure that the peer firewall is responsive and working. To validate the state of the firewall, hello messages are delivered from one peer to the other at the configured Hello Interval.\nThe heartbeat is an ICMP ping over the control link to the HA peer, to which the peer responds to confirm that the firewalls are connected and responding. The heartbeat interval is 1000 milliseconds by default. Every 1000 milliseconds, a ping is issued, and if three consecutive heartbeat losses occur, a failover happens.\nLink monitoring:\nThe monitored physical interfaces are organised into a link group, and their status (link up or link down) is tracked. One or more physical interfaces can be found in a link group. When any or all of the interfaces in a group fail, a firewall failure occurs. The default behaviour is that if any link in the link group fails, the firewall will set the HA status to non-functional (or tentative in active/active mode) to signify a monitored object failure.\nPath monitoring:\nPath Monitoring keeps track of the whole network path to mission-critical IP addresses. Pings using the ICMP protocol are used to check if an IP address is reachable. Ping intervals are set to 200ms by default. When 10 consecutive pings (the default value) fail, an IP address is declared unreachable, and a firewall failure occurs when any or all of the monitored IP addresses become unreachable.

Flood attacks can be of several types, including SYN, ICMP, and UDP. You'll be able to guard against port and host sweeps using the reconnaissance protections. The packet safeguards assist you in defending against big ICMP and ICMP fragment attacks. It is intended to provide broad-based security at the ingress zone (the zone where traffic enters the firewall), rather than protecting a specific end host or traffic heading to a specific destination zone. A zone can have just one zone protection profile attached to it. Configure a DoS Protection policy (Policies > DoS Protection) to match on a specific zone, interface, IP address, or user to enhance zone protection capabilities on the firewall. Because zone protection is based on new connections per second (cps), not packets per second, it is only implemented when there is no session match for the packet (pps).

        "question": "18. What exactly is an APP-ID?",
        "answer": "App-ID is the abbreviated name for application identifications. This is one of Palo Alto's most important elements. App-ID's primary tasks include recognising apps and traversing firewalls independently. App-ID allows you to see and learn about the applications on your network, including how they work, their behavioural features, and their risk level. App-ID, a patented traffic classification technology exclusive to Palo Alto Networks firewalls, determines what an application is regardless of its port, protocol, encryption (SSH or SSL), or any other invasive approach. To effectively identify apps, it uses a combination of classification mechanisms\u2014application signatures, application protocol decoding, and heuristics\u2014on your network traffic stream. This enables for more precise management, such as permitting just sanctioned Office 365 accounts or allowing Slack for instant messaging but not file transmission.",

        "question": "19. In Palo Alto, identify the various deployment modes. ?",
        "answer": "There are four deployment models to choose from: Tap mode deployment option\nVirtual  (V-Wire) Deployment option\nLayer 2 deployment option\nLayer 3 deployment option Tap mode deployment option Tap mode deployment option Virtual  (V-Wire) Deployment option Virtual  (V-Wire) Deployment option Layer 2 deployment option Layer 2 deployment option Layer 3 deployment option Layer 3 deployment option 1. Tap mode deployment option: 1. Tap mode deployment option: With the use of a tap or switch SPAN/mirror port, users can observe any form of traffic flow throughout the networking system. This deployment option has the advantage of allowing enterprises to closely monitor traffic to their servers or networks without requiring any network infrastructure upgrades. It's critical to configure the correct SPAN source and SPAN destination ports, as well as enable Tap mode on the Firewall while configuring SPAN. Although tap mode provides visibility of the application, user, and content, we must keep in mind that the firewall is unable to manage traffic in this mode because no security rules can be enforced. Tap mode just adds visibility to the dashboard's ACC tab. The catch is that the tap interface needs to be allocated to a security zone.   2. Virtual  (V-Wire) Deployment option: 2. Virtual  (V-Wire) Deployment option: The firewall system is installed passively on any network segment using this deployment model, which combines two interfaces. Engineers can monitor and control traffic across the link with V-Wire deployment choices, which overcomes the restrictions of TAP mode deployment. App-ID, User-ID, Content-ID, NAT, and decryption are all supported via the Virtual Wire interface. 3. Layer 2 deployment option: 3. Layer 2 deployment option: Multiple networking interfaces will be configured into a \"virtual-switch\" or VLAN mode in Layer 2 mode. The firewall is set in Layer 2 deployment mode to switch between two or more network segments. Traffic passing via the firewall is analyzed according to policies, enhancing security and visibility within the internal network. The firewall interfaces can support Access or Trunk Links (802.1Q trunking) in this mode, but they are not part of the Spanning Tree topology. Any BPDUs received on the firewall interfaces are routed without being processed to the adjoining Layer 2 switch. A default Gateway, which is commonly a Layer 3 switch that supports InterVLAN routing, a Firewall security appliance, or even a Router-on-a-Stick design, can route traffic across VLAN networks or other networks. 4. Layer 3 deployment option: 4. Layer 3 deployment option: The Palo Alto firewall routes allow traffic to flow between various interfaces in this layer 3 deployments. The IP address should be added to each interface by the user. Layer 3 deployment mode is a common configuration. The firewall directs traffic between many interfaces in this mode, each of which has its own IP address and security zone. The Firewall interfaces can also be set up to get an IP address from a DHCP server and be used to manage the security appliance. The diagram above depicts a typical Layer 3 deployment scenario in which the Firewall routes and regulates traffic between three IP networks. All traffic passing through the Firewall is reviewed and allowed or prohibited according to the security policies established, just like in previous setup methods.",

When a firewall has failed. A monitored object's failure (a link or path). When the firewall goes into a suspended or non-working condition. Sessions and configurations from the peer are synchronised via a firewall in a provisional state. When a firewall in a virtual wire deployment enters a tentative state owing to a path failure and gets a packet to forward, it passes the packet to the peer firewall for processing through the HA3 connection. The packet is processed by the peer firewall and transmitted back to the firewall through the HA3 link to be sent out the egress interface. In a virtual wire deployment, this behaviour keeps the forwarding path intact.\nWhen a firewall in the tentative state receives a packet in a Layer 3 deployment, it transmits it over the HA3 connection to the peer firewall to own or set up the session. This firewall either sends the packet out to the destination or sends it back to the peer in a tentative state for forwarding, depending on the network topology.

The Tentative Hold Time is activated and routing convergence happens after the failed path or link clears or when a failed firewall changes from tentative to active-secondary state. Before processing any packets, the firewall tries to establish routing adjacencies and populate its route table. Without this timer, the recovering firewall would quickly enter active-secondary mode and silently discard packets due to a lack of sufficient routes. After links are up and able to receive incoming packets, a firewall exits suspended mode and enters tentative mode for the Tentative Hold Time. Tentative Hold Time range (sec) can be disabled (default is 0 seconds) or set to a value between 10 and 600 seconds; the default is 60.",

To classify communication based on an IP address, IP range, or subnet, virtual wire subinterfaces can be created. A virtual wire does not necessitate any adjustments to adjacent network devices. A virtual wire can connect two Ethernet interfaces that are on the same medium (copper or fibre optic), or connect a copper interface to a fibre optic interface. Decide which two interfaces to bind (NetworkInterfacesEthernet) and configure their settings accordingly to create a virtual wire.  ",

        "question": "13. Explain Single Pass Software and Parallel Processing Hardware.",
        "answer": "Single Pass Software: Single Pass Software: Within the Palo Alto Networks next-generation firewall, the Palo Alto Networks Single Pass software is meant to achieve two critical purposes. The single-pass software, for starters, only conducts operations once per packet. Networking functions, policy lookup, application identification and decoding, and signature matching for all threats and content are all executed once when a packet is processed. The amount of processing overhead required to conduct numerous functions in a single security device is greatly reduced as a result of this. Second, Palo Alto Networks' Single Pass software's content scanning step is stream-based and uses uniform signature matching to detect and prevent threats. With all security mechanisms engaged, our Single Pass traffic processing offers exceptionally fast throughput and minimal latency. It also comes with a single, fully integrated policy that simplifies and simplifies enterprise network security management. Parallel Processing Hardware: Parallel Processing Hardware: Hardware is the important component of Palo Alto Networks SP3 Architecture. Parallel Processing hardware is used in Palo Alto Networks' next-generation firewalls to ensure that the Single Pass software operates quickly. Palo Alto Networks developers first created data and control planes that were independent. Due to the separation of data and control planes, the strong utilisation of one will not negatively influence the other. For example, an administrator may be running an extremely processor-intensive report while processing packets would be fully unaffected. The employment of discrete, specialised processing groups that work in harmony to accomplish numerous vital operations is the second important aspect of the Parallel Processing hardware. Routing, flow lookup, statistics counting, NAT, and other network-specific activities are all executed on network-specific hardware.\nA multi-core security engine with hardware acceleration for encryption, decryption, and decompression handles User-ID, App-ID, and policy.\nThe content-ID content analysis employs a unique, dedicated content scanning engine.\nWithout touching the data processing hardware, a dedicated management processor (with dedicated disc and RAM) handles configuration management, logging, and reporting on the controlplane.

        "answer": "We recommend using the dedicated HA ports for HA Links and Backup Links when connecting two Palo Alto Networks\u00ae firewalls in a high availability (HA) configuration. The HA1 ports labelled HA1, HA1-A, and HA1-B are used for HA control and synchronisation traffic, whereas the HA2 and High-Speed Chassis Interconnect (HSCI) ports are utilised for HA session setup traffic. AUX-1 and AUX-2 are multipurpose auxiliary ports on the PA-5200 Series firewalls that can be configured for HA1 traffic. The HSCI port, which is utilised for packet forwarding to the partner firewall during session setup and asymmetric traffic flow (active/active HA only), can also be configured for HA3. The HSCI port can be utilised for both HA2 and HA3 traffic. You can use data ports as HA interfaces if your firewall doesn't have specialised HA ports. You can configure data ports as backups to dedicated HA ports if your firewall has dedicated HA ports but not a dedicated HA backup port.",
