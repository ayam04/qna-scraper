        "question": "9. What are the five Scrum values?",
        "answer": "Following are the five Scrum values:   Commitment: Scrum teams must be able to function as a team to accomplish a common goal. This entails putting faith in one another to complete their jobs and deliver to the best of their abilities. It will only occur if each team member is completely dedicated to the project and the team.\nScrum masters and team leaders can aid commitment by facilitating good sprint preparation and shielding teams from mid-sprint scope changes and undue product owner pressure.\nFocus: Each member of the team must remain focused on the work at hand as well as how it affects the sprint goal in order to get the most out of each sprint.\nScrum masters might limit the number of tasks or priorities assigned to each team member throughout sprints to help them stay focused. Individuals can also stay focused on their assigned work by encouraging full team participation in daily Scrum meetings.\nOpenness: Each member of the team must be absolutely truthful about their personal progress in order for the Scrum team to accomplish the maximum progress in the quickest period possible. The daily Scrum meeting's goal is to identify and solve problems. That won't happen if team members aren't honest about any problems or hurdles they're facing. Team members must also be willing to collaborate with one another and see each other as vital contributors to the project's success.\nBeing upfront with their teams is one of the finest methods for Scrum masters to foster openness. Giving honest feedback at daily Scrum meetings is not only crucial for making required adjustments, but it will also inspire team members to be honest and open in return.\nRespect: Respect in a Scrum team implies understanding that no single individual or their contribution is more valuable than another. Respect also entails putting your faith in your coworkers to complete their jobs, listening to and considering their suggestions, and praising their achievements.\nScrum masters may assist their teams to develop regard for each other by exhibiting respect for the product owner, stakeholders, and team members.\nCourage: Scrum teams must have the guts to be genuine, upfront, and honest about the project's progress and any bottlenecks they encounter, both with themselves and with stakeholders. Members of the team must also have the bravery to seek assistance when needed, attempt new techniques or procedures that they are unfamiliar with, and respectfully disagree and engage in open debate.\nScrum masters, like respect, can first and foremost promote courage by displaying it.

        "answer": "Following are the three pillars of Scrum:   Transparency: Those accountable for the outcome must be able to see important components of the process. Transparency necessitates that those elements be defined by a uniform standard so that viewers may comprehend what they are seeing. For example, all participants must speak the same language when referring to the process, and those performing the job and those inspecting the resulting increment must have the same concept of \"done.\"\nInspection: To spot undesired deviations, Scrum users must examine Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal on a regular basis. Their inspections should not be so frequent that they become a hindrance to their work. Inspections are most effective when performed diligently at the point of work by skilled inspectors.\nAdaption: If an inspector concludes that one or more parts of a process deviate beyond acceptable boundaries, the method or the material being processed must be modified. To avoid future deviation, an adjustment must be performed as soon as feasible. Transparency: Those accountable for the outcome must be able to see important components of the process.

        "question": "11. What do you mean by user stories in Scrum? What are the advantages of using them?",
        "answer": "A user story is a casual, generic explanation of a software feature written from the end user's perspective. Its goal is to communicate how a software feature will benefit the customer. Putting people first is a critical component of agile software development, and a user story does just that by putting end-users at the heart of the discussion. The development team and their efforts are described in these anecdotes using non-technical language. The team knows why they're developing, what they're building, and what value it adds after reading a user story.\nFollowing are the advantages of using User Story:-  The main advantage of User Story is the user-centric definition. This is because, in the end, the user will be the one who uses the product in the relevant user scenarios. It establishes a link between end-users and team members.\nThe User Story's syntax ensures that the objective, benefit, or value that the user wishes to attain is captured.\nThe Scrum Team will benefit from the acceptance criteria because they are included in the user story.\nIt is possible to make changes to a user story throughout the project's execution. If the user story's scope grows too large, it must be divided into smaller user stories. The acceptance criterion's conditions can also be changed.

Although it is the product owner's job to ensure that an agile user story backlog exists, this does not imply that the product owner is the one who produces them.\nDuring the early stages of product development, the team discusses needs and records them as user stories. As long as there is a product backlog, it will never be frozen. As a result, if someone thinks there's a missing requirement or anything that could benefit the client, they can add it to the queue as a user story. There is no rule or guideline indicating that the stories must be written solely by the product owner. Because there is a set format, anyone creating the story should know exactly what it means and how to write it. ",

        "question": "17. Why are the user stories not estimated in man hours?",
        "answer": "One of the most common approaches for evaluating teamwork is to estimate in man-hours. While man-hours are simple to comprehend, they have a number of significant drawbacks: Few activities, such as legacy work, are difficult to estimate precisely.\nIf one team member delivers the estimate but the task is completed by another, the estimate is useless.\nThe amount of time it takes to perform a task depends on the developer's level of experience.\nTeams frequently overestimate the obstacles they may face and simply consider the best-case scenario. Few activities, such as legacy work, are difficult to estimate precisely. If one team member delivers the estimate but the task is completed by another, the estimate is useless. The amount of time it takes to perform a task depends on the developer's level of experience. Teams frequently overestimate the obstacles they may face and simply consider the best-case scenario. The benefits of estimating user stories in points include the following: There is no association between the estimator's skills and experience, and story points are independent of the story's author. The team members can estimate more correctly since story points are a measurement of relative sizes, and the size of the story cannot be changed by external forces. As team behavior takes precedence over individual conduct, Story Points encourages collaboration. The team comes together when they use planning poker to estimate story points. As teams exchange, constructively criticize, argue, and have fun playing poker cards to arrive at an agreement on estimations, it serves as a team-building activity.",

        "answer": "Scrum Artifacts contain critical information that the Scrum Team and stakeholders need to know in order to understand the product being developed, the activities that have been completed, and the activities that are planned for the project. The Scrum Process Framework defines the following artifacts:   Product Backlog: The Product Backlog is a list of all the features, functionalities, requirements, additions, and fixes that will be included in future releases of the product. Description, order, estimate, and value are all properties of Product Backlog items.  The Product Owner is in charge of the Product Backlog's content, as well as its availability and ordering.\nSprint Backlog: The Sprint Backlog consists of the Product Backlog items chosen for the Sprint, as well as a strategy for delivering the product increment and achieving the Sprint Goal. It is the Team's projection of what feature will be available in the next Increment, as well as the work required to turn that functionality into a working product Increment.\nIncrement: The Increment is the total of all Product Backlog items accomplished throughout a Sprint plus all preceding Sprint increments. The new Increment must be a working product at the end of a Sprint, which means it must be in usable form. Regardless of whether the Product Owner decides to release it, it must be in functioning condition.\nSprint Burn-Down Chart: The total work remaining in the Sprint Backlog can be totalled at any point throughout the Sprint. The team keeps track of the overall work remaining for each Daily Scrum to estimate the chances of meeting the Sprint Goal.

        "answer": "To manage risk, there are five essential measures to follow. They are as follows:   Identification of Risk: The first step is to determine the risks that the company faces in its current operational environment. There are numerous forms of risks, including legal risks, environmental risks, market risks, regulatory risks, and so on. It's critical to recognize as many of these risk variables as possible.\nAnalysis of the Risk: It is necessary to examine a risk once it has been recognized. The risk's scope must be assessed. It's also crucial to comprehend the relationship between risk and other internal components. It is crucial to establish the severity and importance of the risk by looking at how many business operations it affects.\nRanking the Risk: Risks must be prioritized and ranked. Based on the intensity of the risk, most risk management solutions have several risk categories. Risks that can result in serious loss are ranked the highest, while risks that may cause some inconvenience are rated the lowest.\nTreating the Risk: Every risk must be minimized or eliminated to the greatest extent practicable. This is accomplished by contacting specialists in the field to which the risk pertains. In a manual situation, this means calling each and every stakeholder and then scheduling up meetings for everyone to talk about and debate the concerns.\nReviewing the Risk: The risk is then reviewed to ensure that the risk has been eliminated completely.

The Scrum Master is a facilitator who assists the teams in achieving their objectives. The Scrum Master will apply Scrum methods and urge the team to follow the scrum values during facilitation.\nIt is critical to emphasize that we are discussing encouragement rather than coercion. It is not a project manager's role, but it will assist teams in resolving their roadblocks; it will be a collaborative effort rather than a directive one. The scrum master will try to demonstrate the benefits of adopting the processes and assist the team in gaining a grasp of the scrum processes from time to time, which is similar to demonstrating the proper route but allowing the team to choose whether or not to go down it.
