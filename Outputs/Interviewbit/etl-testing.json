        "answer": "ETL testing is made easier when a testing strategy is well defined. The ETL testing process goes through different phases, as illustrated below:   Analyze Business Requirements: To perform ETL Testing effectively, it is crucial to understand and capture the business requirements through the use of data models, business flow diagrams, reports, etc.\nIdentifying and Validating Data Source: To proceed, it is necessary to identify the source data and perform preliminary checks such as schema checks, table counts, and table validations. The purpose of this is to make sure the ETL process matches the business model specification.\nDesign Test Cases and Preparing Test Data: Step three includes designing ETL mapping scenarios, developing SQL scripts, and defining transformation rules. Lastly, verifying the documents against business needs to make sure they cater to those needs. As soon as all the test cases have been checked and approved, the pre-execution check is performed. All three steps of our ETL processes - namely extracting, transforming, and loading - are covered by test cases.\nTest Execution with Bug Reporting and Closure: This process continues until the exit criteria (business requirements) have been met. In the previous step, if any defects were found, they were sent to the developer for fixing, after which retesting was performed. Moreover, regression testing is performed in order to prevent the introduction of new bugs during the fix of an earlier bug.\nSummary Report and Result Analysis: At this step, a test report is prepared, which lists the test cases and their status (passed or failed). As a result of this report, stakeholders or decision-makers will be able to properly maintain the delivery threshold by understanding the bug and the result of the testing process.\nTest Closure: Once everything is completed, the reports are closed.

        "question": "6. Explain the data cleaning process.",
        "answer": "There is always the possibility of duplicate or mislabeled data when combining multiple data sources. Incorrect data leads to unreliable outcomes and algorithms, even when they appear to be correct. Therefore, consolidation of multiple data representations as well as elimination of duplicate data become essential in order to ensure accurate and consistent data. Here comes the importance of the data cleaning process. Data cleaning can also be referred to as data scrubbing or data cleansing. This refers to the process of removing incomplete, duplicate, corrupt, or incorrect data from a dataset. As the need to integrate multiple data sources becomes more apparent, for example in data warehouses or federated database systems, the significance of data cleaning increases greatly. Because the specific steps in a data cleaning process will vary depending on the dataset, developing a template for your process will ensure that you do it correctly and consistently.",

In general, the architecture has three layers as shown below:   Staging Layer: In a staging layer, or source layer, data is stored that is extracted from multiple data sources.\nData Integration Layer: The integration layer plays the role of transforming data from the staging layer to the database layer.\nAccess Layer: Also called a dimension layer, it allows users to retrieve data for analytical reporting and information retrieval.

        "answer": "In spite of the importance of ETL testing, companies may face some challenges when trying to implement it in their applications. The volume of data involved or the heterogeneous nature of the data makes ETL testing challenging.   Some of these challenges are listed below: Changing customer requirements result in re-running test cases.\nChanging customer requirements may necessitate a tester creating/modifying new mapping documents and SQL scripts, resulting in a long and tedious process.\nUncertainty about business requirements or employees who are not aware of them.\nDuring migration, data loss may occur, making it difficult for source-to-destination reconciliation to take place.\nAn incomplete or corrupt data source.\nReconciliation between data sources and targets may be impacted by incorporating real-time data.\nThere may be memory issues in the system due to the large volume of historical data.\nTesting with inappropriate tools or in an unstable environment.

        "answer": "An important aspect of data warehousing is the fact table. A fact table basically represents the measurements, metrics, or facts of a business process. In fact tables, facts are stored, and they are linked to a number of dimension tables via foreign keys. Facts are usually details and/or aggregated measurements of a business process which can be calculated and grouped to address the business question. Data schemas like the star schema or snowflake schema consist of a central fact table surrounded by several dimension tables. The measures or numbers like sales, cost, profit and loss, etc., are some examples of facts. Fact tables have two types of columns, foreign keys and measures columns. Foreign keys store foreign keys to dimensions, while measures contain numeric facts. Other attributes can be added, depending on the business need and necessity. Types of Facts Types of Facts Facts can be divided into three basic types, as follows:   Additive: Facts that are fully additive are the most flexible and useful. We can sum up additive facts across any dimension associated with the fact table.\nSemi-additive: We can sum up semi-additive facts across some dimensions associated with the fact table, but not all.\nNon-Additive: The Fact table contains non-additive facts, which cannot be summed up for any dimension. The ratio is an example of a non-additive fact. Additive: Facts that are fully additive are the most flexible and useful.

In the Snowflake schema model, multiple hierarchies of dimension tables surround a central fact table.  Alternatively, a dimension table is called a snowflake if its low-cardinality attribute has been segmented into separate normalized tables. These normalized tables are then joined with referential constraints (foreign key constraints) to the original dimensions table. Snowflake schema complexity increases linearly with the level of hierarchy in the dimension tables.
