Then we can see the changes made in the last 3 commits and then update it manually and commit it finally.\n\n- In order to uncommit the last 3 commits and also remove the changes, we can run the command: git reset --hard HEAD~3. This command will completely remove all the changes.\n\n- To look into the changes made in the last 3 commits, we can run git diff HEAD~3\n\n- To make a new commit by reverting the last 3 commits, we can run the command: git revert --no-commit HEAD~3...HEAD A head is nothing but a reference to the last commit object of a branch. head For every repository, there will always be a default head referred to as \u201cmaster\u201d or now \u201cmain\u201d (as per GitHub) but there is no restriction to the count of heads available.

        "answer": "It is always advisable to create an additional commit rather than amending the existing commit due to the following reasons:\n- Doing the amend operation destroys the previously saved state of that commit. If only the commit message gets changes or destroyed, it's acceptable but there might be cases when the contents of the commits get amended. This results in the loss of important information associated with the commit.\n- Over usage of git commit --amend can have severe repercussions as the small commit amend can continue to grow and gather unrelated changes over time.

To handle this, there are two possible approaches based on the situations: Approach 1: Fix the bad changes of the files and create a new commit and push to the remote repository. This step is the simplest and most recommended approach to fix bad changes. You can use the command: git commit -m \"<message>\"\nApproach 2: New commit can be created that reverts changes done in the bad commit.

Git rebasing can be thought of as saying to use another branch as a new base for the work.

If not applied correctly, it results in loss of committed work which might result in breaking the consistency of other developer\u2019s contribution to the repository.\nIf the model of having branches per feature is followed, rebasing is not a good idea there because it keeps track of related commits done by the developers. But in case the team follows having branches per developer of the team, then the branch has no additional useful information to be conveyed. In this model, rebasing has no harm and can be used.\nIf there is any chance where there might be a necessity to revert a commit to previous commits, then reverting a rebase would be almost impossible as the commit data would be destroyed.
