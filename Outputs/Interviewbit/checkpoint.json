They are as follows: Stealth Rule: Stealth is the first recommended rule to include in your rule base. Using this rule, we can prevent direct access to the Security Gateway, thereby providing protection against attacks. Normally, the stealth rule should be placed near the top of the rule base, with only rules that allow or require access to the firewall above it.\nCleanup Rule: Cleanup rules are placed at the end of the security Rulebase. Furthermore, Check Point suggests adding a cleanup rule, which drops and logs every packet that isn't matched by other rules. Logging dropped packets is extremely useful for security and troubleshooting. Stealth Rule: Stealth is the first recommended rule to include in your rule base.

        "question": "8. Explain NAT (Network Address Translation).",
        "answer": "NAT refers to network address translation.  NAT (Network Address Translation) is Firewall Software Blade's feature and ensures greater security by replacing/translating IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. NAT hides internal IP addresses from the Internet in order to protect the identity of a network. A firewall can alter both the source and destination IP addresses of a packet. The firewall, for example, translates the source IP address (to a new one) of packets that go from an internal computer to an external computer. Firewalls translate the new IP addresses back to the original IP addresses as packets return from the external computer. When packets return from the external computer, they are routed to the correct internal computer. Example: Suppose a network has 1,000 computers but one internet connection. What makes it possible that 1000 devices can access one internet connection, right? This is made possible by NAT. A private IP address is assigned to each of the 1000 computers, i.e., (10.0._._), and they are all connected to the router. It is connected directly to the internet and has NAT settings configured. Example:   When PC 1 (which has an IP address of 10.0.0.1) attempts to access the internet (www.google.com), it will first send a request to the router, and the router converts the private IP address into a public IP address (10.0.0.1 - 12.0.0.1) and forwards the request to the Google web server. This information is, however, saved in the NAT forwarding table by the router before forwarding this request. So, when the response comes from the web server, the router can convert the public IP back to the private IP (12.0.0.1 - 10.0.0.1), and deliver the information back to the requested PC.",

        "question": "10. What is the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)?",
        "answer": "The DMZ network, also called a Demilitarized Zone, is a subnetwork within an organization's network infrastructure that lies between the untrusted network (Internet or external network) and the protected internal network. DMZ networks contain the organization's public-facing services and are designed to protect the internal network. A DMZ should contain any services that can be accessed by users connecting from an external network. The most common services are Web servers, mail servers, and FTP (File Transfer Protocol) servers.   For both individuals and large organizations, DMZs are crucial to network security.  They offer an additional layer of security to a computer network by restricting remote access to internal data and servers, which, if breached, can have devastating effects.",

        "question": "11. Explain Security Zone.",
        "answer": "With Security Zones, you can create a powerful Access Control Policy that controls the flow of traffic between different parts of a network. Different security zones are used by networks to protect resources and to combat malware on networks. Set up rules so that only appropriate traffic can enter and leave a security zone. Listed below are the predefined Security Zones, along with their intended purpose: WirelessZone: The network that is accessible via wireless connections by users and applications.\nExternalZone: Unsecured networks, such as the Internet and external networks.\nDMZZone: Demilitarized zones (DMZ) are sometimes called perimeter networks. It contains servers accessible from insecure sources, such as the Internet or external sources.\nInternalZone: Company networks containing sensitive data that needs to be protected and accessed only by authenticated users.

        "question": "12. What do you mean by Asymmetric Encryption?",
        "answer": "There are two types of keys in asymmetric encryption i.e., public and private keys. There is a pair of private and public keys for each party. The public key, as its name implies, can be exchanged securely with communication partners, while the private key must remain confidential (secret). The private key is typically used to decrypt data, while the public key is used to encrypt data.   To encrypt traffic between Jessica and Monica, as depicted in the above figure, the pair will exchange public keys. In order to encrypt Jessica' message to Monica, Jessica will use Monica's public key. Monica will need to use his own private key to decrypt Jessica' message.\nWhen Monica replies to Jessica in the future, the same process will play out. Monica will use Jessica's public key to encrypt his reply message to Jessica.  Jessica will need to use his own private key to decrypt Monica's reply message. In order to encrypt Jessica' message to Monica, Jessica will use Monica's public key. Monica will need to use his own private key to decrypt Jessica' message. When Monica replies to Jessica in the future, the same process will play out. Monica will use Jessica's public key to encrypt his reply message to Jessica.  Jessica will need to use his own private key to decrypt Monica's reply message. Therefore, before any encrypted communication can take place, Jessica and Monica must exchange public keys.",

        "question": "13. Can you explain what is anti-spoofing in Checkpoint?",
        "answer": "The concept of anti-spoofing aims to detect and drop packets with a bogus (false) source address. By using Anti-Spoofing, we can determine if a packet with an IP address concealed behind a certain interface is actually arriving from a different interface. A packet from an external network with an internal IP address, for example, would automatically be blocked by Anti-Spoofing. It ensures that packets are going to and coming from the correct interfaces on the security gateway. Example: Example: In the following diagram, a Security Gateway is shown with interfaces 2, 3, and 4, as well as some example networks.   When Anti-Spoofing is enabled on the Security Gateway, it ensures that: All incoming packets coming to interface 2 should be from the Internet (1)\nAll incoming packets coming to interface 3 should be from 192.168.33.0\nAll incoming packets coming to interface 4 should be from 192.0.2.0 or 10.10.10.0 All incoming packets coming to interface 2 should be from the Internet (1) All incoming packets coming to interface 3 should be from 192.168.33.0 All incoming packets coming to interface 4 should be from 192.0.2.0 or 10.10.10.0 Packets with source IP addresses in network 192.168.33.0 that arrive at interface 2 or 4 are blocked since the source address has been spoofed.",

        "question": "14. How do you prevent IP Spoofing?",
        "answer": "IP spoofing means the use of one\u2019s IP address to appear as if it is a trusted IP address, usually for DDoS attacks or to reroute communication. A hacker uses IP spoofing to replace an untrustworthy source IP address with a fake, trusted one in order to hijack connections to your network. Attackers can send malware and bots to your network, execute DoS attacks, and gain unauthorized access to your systems.\n\nIP Spoofing can be prevented with Anti-spoofing. Anti Spoofing aims to detect and drop packets with a bogus (false) source address to prevent unauthorized access to your systems and secure your network.  ",
