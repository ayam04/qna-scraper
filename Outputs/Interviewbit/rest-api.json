        "question": "1. What do you understand by RESTful Web Services?",
        "answer": "RESTful web services are services that follow REST architecture. REST stands for Representational State Transfer and uses HTTP protocol (web protocol) for implementation. These services are lightweight, provide maintainability, scalability, support communication among multiple applications that are developed using different programming languages. They provide means of accessing resources present at server required for the client via the web browser by means of request headers, request body, response body, status codes, etc.",

        "answer": "The disadvantages are: As the services follow the idea of statelessness, it is not possible to maintain sessions. (Session simulation responsibility lies on the client-side to pass the session id)\nREST does not impose security restrictions inherently. It inherits the security measures of the protocols implementing it. Hence, care must be chosen to implement security measures like integrating SSL/TLS based authentications, etc. As the services follow the idea of statelessness, it is not possible to maintain sessions.

        "question": "4. What are the HTTP Methods?",
        "answer": "HTTP Methods are also known as HTTP Verbs. They form a major portion of uniform interface restriction followed by the REST that specifies what action has to be followed to get the requested resource. Below are some examples of HTTP Methods: GET: This is used for fetching details from the server and is basically a read-only operation.\nPOST: This method is used for the creation of new resources on the server.\nPUT: This method is used to update the old/existing resource on the server or to replace the resource.\nDELETE: This method is used to delete the resource on the server.\nPATCH: This is used for modifying the resource on the server.\nOPTIONS: This fetches the list of supported options of resources present on the server. GET: This is used for fetching details from the server and is basically a read-only operation. POST: This method is used for the creation of new resources on the server. PUT: This method is used to update the old/existing resource on the server or to replace the resource. DELETE: This method is used to delete the resource on the server. PATCH: This is used for modifying the resource on the server. OPTIONS: This fetches the list of supported options of resources present on the server. The POST, GET, PUT, DELETE corresponds to the create, read, update, delete operations which are most commonly called CRUD Operations. CRUD Operations   GET, HEAD, OPTIONS are safe and idempotent methods whereas PUT and DELETE methods are only idempotent. POST and PATCH methods are neither safe nor idempotent.",

        "question": "3. What are the best practices to develop RESTful web services?",
        "answer": "RESTful web services use REST API as means of implementation using the HTTP protocol. REST API is nothing but an application programming interface that follows REST architectural constraints such as statelessness, cacheability, maintainability, and scalability. It has become very popular among the developer community due to its simplicity. Hence, it is very important to develop safe and secure REST APIs that follow good conventions. Below are some best practices for developing REST APIs: Since REST supports multiple data formats, it is however good practice to develop REST APIs that accept and responds with JSON data format whenever possible. This is because a majority of the client and server technologies have inbuilt support to read and parse JSON objects with ease, thereby making JSON the standard object notation.\nTo ensure that the application responds using JSON data format, the response header should have Content-Type set to as application/JSON, this is because certain HTTP clients look at the value of this response header to parse the objects appropriately.\nTo ensure that the request sends the data in JSON format, again the Content-Type must be set to application/JSON on the request header.\nWhile naming the resource endpoints, ensure to use plural nouns and not verbs. The API endpoints should be clear, brief, easy to understand, and informative. Using verbs in the resource name doesn\u2019t contribute much information because an HTTP request already has what the request is doing in its HTTP method/verb. An appropriate HTTP verb should be used to represent the task of the API endpoint.\nBelow are the most commonly used HTTP methods to define the verb:\nGET - indicates get/retrieve the resource data\nPOST - indicates create new resource data\nPUT - indicates update the existing resource data\nDELETE - indicates remove the resource data\nTo represent the hierarchy of resources, use the nesting in the naming convention of the endpoints. In case, you want to retrieve data of one object residing in another object, the endpoint should reflect this to communicate what is happening. For example, to get the address of an author, we can use the GET method for the URI /authors/:id/address'\nPlease ensure there are no more than 2 or 3 levels of nesting as the name of the URI can become too long and unwieldy.\nError Handling should be done gracefully by returning appropriate error codes the application has encountered. REST has defined standard HTTP Status codes that can be sent along with the response based on the scenario.\nError codes should also be accompanied by appropriate error messages that can help the developers to take corrective actions. However, the message should not be too elaborate as well which can help the hacker to hack your application.\nCommon status codes are:\n400 - Bad Request \u2013 client-side error - failed input validation.\n401 - Unauthorized \u2013 The user is not authenticated and hence does not have authority to access the resource.\n403 - Forbidden \u2013 User is authenticated but is not authorized to access the resource.\n404 - Not Found \u2013 The resource is not found.\n500 - Internal server error \u2013 This is a very generic server-side error that is thrown when the server goes down. This shouldn\u2019t be returned by the programmer explicitly.\n502 - Bad Gateway \u2013 Server did not receive a valid response from the upstream server.\n503 - Service Unavailable \u2013 Some unexpected things happened on the server such as system failure, overload, etc.\nWhile retrieving huge resource data, it is advisable to include filtering and pagination of the resources. This is because returning huge data all at once can slow down the system and reduce the application performance. Hence, filter some items reduces the data to some extent. Pagination of data is done to ensure only some results are sent at a time. Doing this can increase the server performance and reduce the burden of the server resources.\nGood security practices are a must while developing REST APIs. The client-server communication must be private due to the nature of data sensitivity. Hence, incorporating SSL/TLS becomes the most important step while developing APIs as they facilitate establishing secure communication. SSL certificates are easier to get and load on the server.\nApart from the secure channels, we need to ensure that not everyone should be able to access the resource. For example, normal users should not access the data of admins or another user. Hence, role-based access controls should be in place to make sure only the right set of users can access the right set of data.\nSince REST supports the feature of caching, we can use this feature to cache the data in order to improve the application performance. Caching is done to avoid querying the database for a request repeated times. Caching makes data retrieval fast. However, care must be taken to ensure that the cache has updated data and not outdated ones. Frequent cache update measures need to be incorporated. There are many cache providers like Redis that can assist in caching.\nAPI Versioning: Versioning needs to be done in case we are planning to make any changes with the existing endpoints. We do not want to break communication between our application and the apps that consume our application while we are working on the API release. The transition has to be seamless. Semantic versioning can be followed. For example, 3.0.1 represents 3rd major version with the first patch. Usually, in the API endpoints, we define /v1,/v2, etc at the beginning of the API path. Since REST supports multiple data formats, it is however good practice to develop REST APIs that accept and responds with JSON data format whenever possible. This is because a majority of the client and server technologies have inbuilt support to read and parse JSON objects with ease, thereby making JSON the standard object notation.\nTo ensure that the application responds using JSON data format, the response header should have Content-Type set to as application/JSON, this is because certain HTTP clients look at the value of this response header to parse the objects appropriately.\nTo ensure that the request sends the data in JSON format, again the Content-Type must be set to application/JSON on the request header.

This is because returning huge data all at once can slow down the system and reduce the application performance. Hence, filter some items reduces the data to some extent. Pagination of data is done to ensure only some results are sent at a time. Doing this can increase the server performance and reduce the burden of the server resources. Good security practices are a must while developing REST APIs. The client-server communication must be private due to the nature of data sensitivity. Hence, incorporating SSL/TLS becomes the most important step while developing APIs as they facilitate establishing secure communication. SSL certificates are easier to get and load on the server.\nApart from the secure channels, we need to ensure that not everyone should be able to access the resource. For example, normal users should not access the data of admins or another user. Hence, role-based access controls should be in place to make sure only the right set of users can access the right set of data. Apart from the secure channels, we need to ensure that not everyone should be able to access the resource. For example, normal users should not access the data of admins or another user.

Hence, role-based access controls should be in place to make sure only the right set of users can access the right set of data. Since REST supports the feature of caching, we can use this feature to cache the data in order to improve the application performance. Caching is done to avoid querying the database for a request repeated times. Caching makes data retrieval fast. However, care must be taken to ensure that the cache has updated data and not outdated ones. Frequent cache update measures need to be incorporated. There are many cache providers like Redis that can assist in caching. API Versioning: Versioning needs to be done in case we are planning to make any changes with the existing endpoints. We do not want to break communication between our application and the apps that consume our application while we are working on the API release. The transition has to be seamless. Semantic versioning can be followed. For example, 3.0.1 represents 3rd major version with the first patch. Usually, in the API endpoints, we define /v1,/v2, etc at the beginning of the API path. /v1 /v2",

        "question": "4. What are Idempotent methods? How is it relevant in RESTful web services domain?",
        "answer": "The meaning of idempotent is that even after calling a single request multiple times, the outcome of the request should be the same. While designing REST APIs, we need to keep in mind to develop idempotent APIs. This is because the consumers can write client-side code which can result in duplicate requests intentionally or not. Hence, fault-tolerant APIs need to be designed so that they do not result in erroneous responses. Idempotent methods ensure that the responses to a request if called once or ten times or more than that remain the same. This is equivalent to adding any number with 0.\nREST provides idempotent methods automatically. GET, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, and TRACE are the idempotent HTTP methods. POST is not idempotent.\nPOST is not idempotent because POST APIs are usually used for creating a new resource on the server. While calling POST methods N times, there will be N new resources. This does not result in the same outcome at a time.\nMethods like GET, OPTIONS, TRACE, and HEAD are idempotent because they do not change the state of resources on the server. They are meant for resource retrieval whenever called. They do not result in write operations on the server thereby making it idempotent.\nPUT methods are generally used for updating the state of resources. If you call PUT methods N times, the first request updates the resource and the subsequent requests will be overwriting the same resource again and again without changing anything. Hence, PUT methods are idempotent.\nDELETE methods are said to be idempotent because when calling them for N times, the first request results in successful deletion (Status Code 200), and the next subsequent requests result in nothing - Status Code 204. The response is different, but there is no change of resources on the server-side.\nHowever, if you are attempting to delete the resource present, at last, every time you hit the API, such as the request DELETE /user/last which deletes the last user record, then calling the request N times would delete N resources on the server. This does not make DELETE idempotent. In such cases, as part of good practices, it is advisable to use POST requests.

It is used for secure communication as it is the successor of the Secure Socket Layer (SSL). HTTPS works well with both TLS and SSL thereby making it effective while implementing RESTful web services. One point to mention here is, the REST inherits the property of the protocol it implements.

        "question": "3. Is it possible to make asynchronous requests in JAX-RS?",
        "answer": "Yes. the JAX-RS Client API provides a method called Invocation.Builder.async() that is used for constructing client requests that need to be executed asynchronously. Invoking a request asynchronously does the task of returning the control to the caller by returning with datatype java.util.concurrent.Future whose type is set to return the service call type. Future objects are used because they have the required methods to check whether the asynchronous calls have been completed and if yes, then retrieve the responses. They also provide the flexibility to cancel the request invocations and also check if the cancellation has been successful. Invocation.Builder.async() java.util.concurrent.Future Let us understand this with the help of a random example. We know that the Future interface from the java.util.concurrent has the below functions available: Future java.util.concurrent package java.util.concurrent;\npublic interface Future<V> {\n   // informs the executor to stop the thread execution\n   boolean cancel(boolean mayInterruptIfRunning);\n   \n   // indicates whether the Future was cancelled or not\n   boolean isCancelled();\n   \n   // indicates if the executor has completed the task\n   boolean isDone();\n   \n   // gets the actual result from the process. \n   // This blocks the program execution until the result is ready.\n   V get() throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException;\n   \n   // also gets actual result from the process but it throws \n   // the TimeoutException in case the result is not obtained before specified timeout\n   V get(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)\n       throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException, TimeoutException;\n} package java.util.concurrent;\npublic interface Future<V> {\n   // informs the executor to stop the thread execution\n   boolean cancel(boolean mayInterruptIfRunning);\n   \n   // indicates whether the Future was cancelled or not\n   boolean isCancelled();\n   \n   // indicates if the executor has completed the task\n   boolean isDone();\n   \n   // gets the actual result from the process. \n   // This blocks the program execution until the result is ready.\n   V get() throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException;\n   \n   // also gets actual result from the process but it throws \n   // the TimeoutException in case the result is not obtained before specified timeout\n   V get(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)\n       throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException, TimeoutException;\n} package public interface Future<V> interface Future V // informs the executor to stop the thread execution boolean cancel(boolean mayInterruptIfRunning) boolean cancel (boolean mayInterruptIfRunning) boolean // indicates whether the Future was cancelled or not boolean isCancelled() boolean isCancelled () // indicates if the executor has completed the task boolean isDone() boolean isDone () // gets the actual result from the process. // This blocks the program execution until the result is ready. V get() throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException get () throws // also gets actual result from the process but it throws // the TimeoutException in case the result is not obtained before specified timeout V get(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)\n       throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException, TimeoutException get (long timeout, TimeUnit unit) long throws Let us consider we have this function below which is used for processing 2 Ids parallelly. public void processIds(String userId1, String questionId){\n   Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();\n   Future<Response> futureResponse1 = client.target(\"http://interviewbitserver.com/users/\"+userId).request().async().get();\n   Future<Order> futureResponse2 = client.target(\"http://interviewbitserver.com/questions/\"+questionId).request().async().get(Question.class);\n   \n   // block the process until complete\n   Response response1 = futureResponse1.get();\n   User userObject = response1.readEntity(User.class);\n   //Do processing of userObject\n   \n   // Wait for 2 seconds before fetching record\n   try {\n      Question question = futureResponse2.get(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS);\n      //Do Processing of question\n   } catch (TimeoutException timeoutException ) {\n       //handle exceptions\n   }\n   return;\n} public void processIds(String userId1, String questionId){\n   Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();\n   Future<Response> futureResponse1 = client.target(\"http://interviewbitserver.com/users/\"+userId).request().async().get();\n   Future<Order> futureResponse2 = client.target(\"http://interviewbitserver.com/questions/\"+questionId).request().async().get(Question.class);\n   \n   // block the process until complete\n   Response response1 = futureResponse1.get();\n   User userObject = response1.readEntity(User.class);\n   //Do processing of userObject\n   \n   // Wait for 2 seconds before fetching record\n   try {\n      Question question = futureResponse2.get(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS);\n      //Do Processing of question\n   } catch (TimeoutException timeoutException ) {\n       //handle exceptions\n   }\n   return;\n} public void processIds(String userId1, String questionId) public void processIds (String userId1, String questionId) \"http://interviewbitserver.com/users/\" \"http://interviewbitserver.com/questions/\" // block the process until complete //Do processing of userObject // Wait for 2 seconds before fetching record try 2 //Do Processing of question catch //handle exceptions return In the above example, we see that there are 2 separate requests getting executed parallelly. For the first future object, we await the javax.ws.rs.core.Response indefinitely using the get() method until we get the response. For the second future object, we wait for the response only for 2 seconds and if we do not get within 2 seconds, then the get() method throws TimeoutException. We can also use the isDone() method or isCancelled() method to find out whether the executors have completed or cancelled. javax.ws.rs.core.Response",
