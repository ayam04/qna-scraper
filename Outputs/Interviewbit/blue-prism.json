        "question": "2. What are match index and match reverse?",
        "answer": "When you are using an application modeller to identify an application element, you will see two attributes called match index and match reverse. They are available for all types of applications. Both Match Index and Match Reverse are used to control how Blue Prism searches for the element at runtime. Match Index: Essentially, Blue Prism searches or looks for elements within the target application whose attributes match those selected in the application model by the developer. In the case of multiple elements matching, more than one element is highlighted. In the case of a Match Index set to 1, Blue Prism will stop looking or searching for elements as soon as it finds the first matching element. When set to 2, the search will stop if a second element matching the criteria is found, and that element will be highlighted instead of the first. This attribute can increase search speed significantly, but it is recommended only for cases in which duplicate elements can be ignored or are unlikely. \nMatch Reverse: This feature allows Blue Prism to search in a bottom-up manner rather than the default top-down manner.

        "answer": "  RPA (Robotic process automation) is defined as a software technology that provides the ability to easily build, deploy, and manage bots (also called software robots) that simulate human actions in interaction with digital systems and software. In simple terms, RPA is the process of automating business operations, which reduces human intervention and increases productivity. The RPA automation technique allows users to make bots by observing human actions. Make your bots aware of what to do, and then let them handle the work. RPA bots are able to interact with any system or application the exact same way a human does, like reading screen content and completing keystrokes, navigating systems, identifying and extracting data, and performing a wide range of defined actions or tasks - except that RPA bots can operate 24/7, nonstop, faster and with 100% accuracy and reliability.

        "answer": "Blue Prism solutions place a strong emphasis on exception management. Whenever a mistake occurs in the Blue Prism, it generates an exception. By \"exception handling,\" we mean managing exceptions during unassisted automation. As a result, problems can be automatically resolved if possible or can be quickly identified and repaired by system administrators or by humans if necessary. In the event of an error or exception, Blue Prism must stop processing and notify system administrators or users about the problem.   Exception handling can be achieved by using the following stages: Recovery: The Recover Stage allows you to recover from an exception. In the event of an exception on a page containing a Recovery Stage, the process continues there. When the process flow is transferred to the Recover Stage, the process remains in Recovery Mode until the Resume Stage or an exception is encountered.\nResume: This stage indicates that recovery is complete, and normal processing is resumed. Although the resume stage suppresses the exception, it does not resolve the problem. Once the resume stage is complete, the exception is essentially gone, and the process can continue as usual.\nException: The exception stage is used for raising exceptions or errors at any point in the process flow.

Essentially, it consists of the configuration needed to interact with existing applications and UI (user interface) elements. A software bot identifies these elements based on specific attributes and then interacts and performs the desired operation on them. It lets you run/execute Blue Prism and your target application simultaneously (side-by-side), and you can tell Object Studio about the features of your target application by pointing and clicking. You can add elements representing user interface elements to the Application Model by opening the Application Modeller and selecting \"Add Element\".

Navigate stage: This stage allows you to navigate or perform actions in your target application, such as clicking buttons, opening menus, dialog boxes, sending keystrokes, closing windows, etc.\nRead stage: This stage involves reading data from your target application and storing it into data items in VBO (Visual Business Object).\nWrite stage: In the write stage, data is written from data items to your target application.\nCode stage: The stage allows experienced users to perform data manipulations from within Blue Prism that would otherwise be cumbersome, or to interact with the API of another piece of software from within Blue Prism. A code stage can be particularly useful if you need to interface with a COM object in a Microsoft Windows environment. The blue prism code stage does not allow programming in Java, but in Python, Powershell, C++, etc.\nWait stage: By using the Wait stage, you can pause the execution of a business object until certain conditions are met in the target application. For instance, you might wait until a window appears, or you might wait for a particular message to appear in the status bar. The Wait Stage always executes the path of or applies the first true condition and, if the time runs out or the timeout expires, it can perform further actions or raise an Exception if something hasn't worked out as expected. Exceptions at the Timeout stage will alert the Process that an error has occurred. Wait stages can exist without any conditions, and timeouts can be used as pauses.

In the event that the current process is not completed, Blue Prism will mark it as an Exception during clean-up. While right-clicking on the running process session, you see mainly two-stop options: Request Stop: Requests the processes to stop at a configured safe stop during their process execution.\nImmediate Stop: Clicking the Immediate Stop button will stop the process wherever it is currently running at that moment. It behaves similarly to the Stop section. Request Stop: Requests the processes to stop at a configured safe stop during their process execution.

        "question": "4. What is the use of the Preserve Checkbox in Blue Prism?",
        "answer": "Exception Type and Exception Details are disabled when you check the Preserve checkbox. If the Preserve checkbox is checked, the current exception is thrown again or re-released, and no further details are needed. As a result, you must use the Preserve checkbox in the Recovery Mode, which is between the Recover and Resume stages. In addition, the checkbox will generate an exception if it is used outside the Recovery mode.",

        "question": "5. What are Multiple-Part Processes?",
        "answer": "Multiple-Part processes are used when a case has to be dealt with in multiple parts at separate/different items. Each work queue item is associated with one request via a parent-child relationship. You can also use this when work is driven from another/external system instead of the Blue Prism work queue. In addition to this, the Multiple-Part process can be used when requests are added throughout a day and must be executed within the service-level agreement period.",

User: It is used to assign information about new users. User: Credentials: It is used to store confidential information. Credentials: Options: This allows you to assign rules for setting passwords. Options: Among other security features, Blue Prism provides role-based access control. Therefore, the Blue Prism administrator can define which roles a user is allowed to act in, and the system will allow that user to only performs actions allowed by those roles. Additionally, administrators can review and examine records of user activities, including when a user logs in to Blue Prism, when the user starts or stops a process, when the user changes the password, etc.",

    {
        "question": "7. Is Blue Prism's platform auditable and secure?",
        "answer": "Yes. The Blue Prism platform is both secure and auditable, as security and auditability are built into the platform at several levels. Blue Prism's runtime environment is separate from its process editing environment. In addition, each and every authorized user is given specific permissions for creating, editing, and running processes. As well, a full audit trail of all changes to any process is kept, along with a comparison of the before and after effects of each change. Additionally, the log that is created during the runtime/execution of each process provides a full-detailed, time-stamped history of each decision as well as action taken within an automated process.",

        "question": "8. Can you explain what the Blue Prism Process Template is?",
        "answer": "The Blue Prism templates serve as blueprints for all processes created in Blue Prism, making them easy to configure and maintain. A process template is primarily intended to be used by developers to automate processes quickly. The process templates contain basic activities and structure, so developers do not need to create them every time. Furthermore, they provide developers with an understanding of how work queues are implemented in the Blue Prism processes. The templates streamline the overall working process and make it easier to create processes quickly and easily configured.",

        "question": "9. Explain environment locking in Blue Prism.",
        "answer": "Blue Prism sessions are able to use environment locks to restrict access to specific resources or critical sections of the process so that other sessions are forced to wait until the lock is released. By doing so, multiple bots cannot access the same path of a process at the same time. The environment lock works by using tokens. During environmental locking, a token is generated to grant access to only one bot at a time. Once the first bot acquires the lock, it will receive the token, and the other bot will not be able to access the environment or excel file until the first bot releases the lock or token.",

        "question": "12. What is the use of the work queue in Blue Prism?",
        "answer": "Work queues are basically a way of modelling the queuing, locking, and reporting of work items in the Blue Prism environment. Each queue contains a range of work items that can be locked and worked on within a process or business object. The work queues business object is used to manage and handle the queues. This business object lets you retrieve items from the queue, update the metadata associated with the items, and report on the queue. It is possible to create and configure as many work queues as you want within System Manager. The Queue Management panel within the Control Room can be used to monitor and alter queue items. To access the Queue Management panel, open the Control Room and click the Queue Management tab. It is here where you can pause/resume queues, view queue items, delete them or mark them with exceptions.",
