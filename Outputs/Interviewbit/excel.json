        "question": "14. Differentiate between the terms \"absolute cell referencing\" and \"relative cell referencing\" in Microsoft Excel.",
        "answer": "Instead of using values while generating a formula, we use cell references. In this method, as we alter the values of the cells, the formula's outcome also alters. References come in two varieties: Relative Reference: Relative references indicate the precise location of the cell, and it is the row and column in which the cell that has a value or a formula is situated. If we try taking that same cell to relocate it to another cell, worth the redundancy, it will refer to the new cells according to where they are located. As a result, we can claim that Excel predetermines relative references. Example: See the illustration below, where there is a formula written in C9 and copied to C10. As you can see, C10, as opposed to A9 and B9, displays the total of A10 and B10.

In other words, it constantly refers to the same cell, making it impossible to change them during copying. Absolute references are crucial since they are fixed, which is excellent when using Excel functions or formulae. Example: The $ symbol must come before the column and row numbers if you want to use absolute referencing. The row and column addresses do not change when absolute cell references are used; they stay the same.

        "answer": "ExcelLibrary can be used to create Excel files in C# without the need to install Microsoft Office. It is an open-source, cost-free, and basic library on Google Code. It is a PHP ExcelWriter port. It includes a DataSetHelper that makes using DataSets and DataTables easier. ExcelLibrary supports the older Excel format (.xls files), and support for the more recent 2007/2010 formats will be added. The alternative is EPPlus. It has NPOI and is compatible with Excel 2007/2010 format files (.xlsx files). Pivot Tables are also supported by EPPlus.",

        "answer": "What-if analysis is a technique for changing one or more cellular formulas to examine how the changes affect the worksheet results. Three different What-if approaches for analysis are available in Excel: Scenarios, Goal Seek, and Data Tables. Data tables and scenarios offer a selection of inputs for potential results. While several variables can work with scenarios, a limit of 32 input values is allowed.  Data tables only work with one or two variables, but they can all take on a variety of different values. Unlike Scenarios and Data Tables, Goal Seek takes outputs and determines prospective inputs to the same.   Source: Wmfexcel",

        "answer": "When there are no exact matches for the provided lookup_value, VLOOKUP will fetch values to get an approximate match. Set the range_lookup value to TRUE for a rough match. Keep in mind that for VLOOKUP to do an approximate match, the table must be ordered in ascending order. In this case, VLOOKUP basically starts by searching for a roughly matching value to the specified lookup value before stopping at the value that is the next largest. It then enters that row to return the value from the designated column. Example:   Choose the target cell, then enter \"=\".\nDeploy VLOOKUP.\nAdd the lookup value to the list of parameters.\nUse TRUE as the range lookup value.\nThe function will be =VLOOKUP (55, A12: C15, 3, TRUE) Choose the target cell, then enter \"=\". Deploy VLOOKUP. Add the lookup value to the list of parameters. Use TRUE as the range lookup value. The function will be =VLOOKUP (55, A12: C15, 3, TRUE) The lookup value is 55 and the next largest value near the lookup value that is present in the first column is 40. Hence, the output is \u2018Second Class\u2019.",
