        "answer": "Web API (Application Programming Interface), as the name suggests, is an API that can be accessed over the Web using the HTTP protocol. It is basically considered the best platform for revealing or uncovering data and services to various different services. It is a tool that can be used to push data to a server and can be accessed by server code. It can be built or developed using various technologies like java, ASP.NET, etc.   Web API Uses:  Web API Uses: It contains additional layers that simply standardize communications and provide different options on how to format input and output.\nIt can be used with ASP.NET MVC and different types of web applications such as ASP.NET WebForms.\nIf one wants to create resource-oriented services, then Web API services are considered the best.\nIt also helps to develop REST-ful services and SOAP-based services.

It is basically a process that decides which action and controller should be called. The controller is basically a class that handles all HTTP requests. All public methods of controllers are basically known as action methods or just actions. Whenever a Web API framework receives any type of request, it routes that request to action. There are basically two ways to implement routing in Web API as given below:\nConvention-based routing: Web API supports convention-based routing. In this type of routing, Web API uses route templates to select which controller and action method to execute. \n\nAttribute-based routing: Web API 2 generally supports a new type of routing known as attribute routing. As the name suggests, it uses attributes to define routes. It is the ability to add routes to the route table via attributes.  Convention-based routing   Attribute-based routing  ",

One needs to secure Web API by controlling Web API and by deciding who can and who cannot have access to Web API. There are basically two ways or techniques that make our Web API more secure. \n\nAuthentication: It is a process that helps to identify and check users by their credentials such as password, username, etc. To have access to the web API, firstly user credentials are needed to be passed in the request header. If user credentials are not passed into the request header, then the server returns 401 status code (unauthorized). The best authentication to be used is OAuth 2.0. \n\nAuthorization: It is a process that helps to decide whether or not a user has access to perform an action.
