Web service architecture is used to assist the developer with steps and procedures that are essential to complete the creation. Web service architecture includes three distinct roles i.e., service provider, service requester, and service registry. It also includes three different operations that include:  \n\nPublish (Publication of Service Descriptions): A service description needs to be published so that the service requestor can locate and have access to it. It can be published anywhere depending upon the requirements of the application. \n\nFind (Finding of Services Descriptions): A service description is retrieved directly by a service requestor. The requestor consults the broker to locate a web service that is already published. \n\nBind (Invoking of Service based on Service Description): Every service needs to be invoked. To locate, contact, and invoke the service, the service requestor initiates the interaction with the service at runtime using details of binding in the service description.

Examining the web service protocol stack is considered as the second option for viewing the web service architecture. In simple words, it is the set of protocols that are used to explore and execute web services. Currently, the web service protocol stack has four layers as given below:   Service Transport: It is generally responsible to transport messages between applications. It basically defines technology standards for communication and allows messages or information to move across the network without any difficulty. It uses HTTP, SMTP, FTP, and DEEP protocols to transfer information.  \nXML Messaging: It is generally responsible to encode messages into XML format so that one can understand these messages at either end. This layer generally includes XML-RPC and SOAP.  \nService Description: It is generally responsible to describe the public interface to a specific web service. WSDL is generally used to handle service descriptions.\nService Discovery: It is generally responsible to centralize service into a common registry and provides easy functionality for publishing or finding web services.
