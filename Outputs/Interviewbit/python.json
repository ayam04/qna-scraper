Scoping Modules, in general, are simply Python files with a .py extension and can have a set of functions, classes, or variables defined and implemented. They can be imported and initialized once using the import statement. If partial functionality is needed, import the requisite classes or functions using from foo import bar. Modules import from foo import bar Packages allow for hierarchial structuring of the module namespace using dot notation. As, modules help avoid clashes between global variable names, in a similar manner, packages help avoid clashes between module names.\nCreating a package is easy since it makes use of the system's inherent file structure. So just stuff the modules into a folder and there you have it, the folder name as the package name. Importing a module or its contents from this package requires the package name as prefix to the module name joined by a dot. Packages dot notation modules packages  Note: You can technically import the package as well, but alas, it doesn't import the modules within the package to the local namespace, thus, it is practically useless.

        "answer": "Python comprehensions, like decorators, are syntactic sugar constructs that help build altered and filtered lists, dictionaries, or sets from a given list, dictionary, or set. Using comprehensions saves a lot of time and code that might be considerably more verbose (containing more lines of code). Let's check out some examples, where comprehensions can be truly beneficial: syntactic sugar build altered filtered lists Performing mathematical operations on the entire list Performing mathematical operations on the entire list Performing mathematical operations on the entire list my_list = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]\nsquared_list = [x**2 for x in my_list]    # list comprehension\n# output => [4 , 9 , 25 , 49 , 121]\nsquared_dict = {x:x**2 for x in my_list}    # dict comprehension\n# output => {11: 121, 2: 4 , 3: 9 , 5: 25 , 7: 49} my_list = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]\nsquared_list = [x**2 for x in my_list]    # list comprehension\n# output => [4 , 9 , 25 , 49 , 121]\nsquared_dict = {x:x**2 for x in my_list}    # dict comprehension\n# output => {11: 121, 2: 4 , 3: 9 , 5: 25 , 7: 49} 2 3 5 7 11 2 for in # list comprehension # output => [4 , 9 , 25 , 49 , 121] 2 for in # dict comprehension # output => {11: 121, 2: 4 , 3: 9 , 5: 25 , 7: 49} Performing conditional filtering operations on the entire list Performing conditional filtering operations on the entire list Performing conditional filtering operations on the entire list my_list = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]\nsquared_list = [x**2 for x in my_list if x%2 != 0]    # list comprehension\n# output => [9 , 25 , 49 , 121]\nsquared_dict = {x:x**2 for x in my_list if x%2 != 0}    # dict comprehension\n# output => {11: 121, 3: 9 , 5: 25 , 7: 49} my_list = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]\nsquared_list = [x**2 for x in my_list if x%2 != 0]    # list comprehension\n# output => [9 , 25 , 49 , 121]\nsquared_dict = {x:x**2 for x in my_list if x%2 != 0}    # dict comprehension\n# output => {11: 121, 3: 9 , 5: 25 , 7: 49} 2 3 5 7 11 2 for in if 2 0 # list comprehension # output => [9 , 25 , 49 , 121] 2 for in if 2 0 # dict comprehension # output => {11: 121, 3: 9 , 5: 25 , 7: 49} Combining multiple lists into one Combining multiple lists into one Combining multiple lists into one Comprehensions allow for multiple iterators and hence, can be used to combine multiple lists into one. a = [1, 2, 3]\nb = [7, 8, 9]\n[(x + y) for (x,y) in zip(a,b)]  # parallel iterators\n# output => [8, 10, 12]\n[(x,y) for x in a for y in b]    # nested iterators\n# output => [(1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9)] a = [1, 2, 3]\nb = [7, 8, 9]\n[(x + y) for (x,y) in zip(a,b)]  # parallel iterators\n# output => [8, 10, 12]\n[(x,y) for x in a for y in b]    # nested iterators\n# output => [(1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9)] 1 2 3 7 8 9 for in zip # parallel iterators # output => [8, 10, 12] for in for in # nested iterators # output => [(1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9)] Flattening a multi-dimensional list Flattening a multi-dimensional list Flattening a multi-dimensional list A similar approach of nested iterators (as above) can be applied to flatten a multi-dimensional list or work upon its inner elements. my_list = [[10,20,30],[40,50,60],[70,80,90]]\nflattened = [x for temp in my_list for x in temp]\n# output => [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90] my_list = [[10,20,30],[40,50,60],[70,80,90]]\nflattened = [x for temp in my_list for x in temp]\n# output => [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90] 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 for in for in # output => [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90] Note: List comprehensions have the same effect as the map method in other languages.

        "question": "2. What are decorators in Python?",
        "answer": "Decorators in Python are essentially functions that add functionality to an existing function in Python without changing the structure of the function itself. They are represented the @decorator_name in Python and are called in a bottom-up fashion. For example: Decorators @decorator_name # decorator function to convert to lowercase\ndef lowercase_decorator(function):\n   def wrapper():\n       func = function()\n       string_lowercase = func.lower()\n       return string_lowercase\n   return wrapper\n# decorator function to split words\ndef splitter_decorator(function):\n   def wrapper():\n       func = function()\n       string_split = func.split()\n       return string_split\n   return wrapper\n@splitter_decorator # this is executed next\n@lowercase_decorator # this is executed first\ndef hello():\n   return 'Hello World'\nhello()   # output => [ 'hello' , 'world' ] # decorator function to convert to lowercase\ndef lowercase_decorator(function):\n   def wrapper():\n       func = function()\n       string_lowercase = func.lower()\n       return string_lowercase\n   return wrapper\n# decorator function to split words\ndef splitter_decorator(function):\n   def wrapper():\n       func = function()\n       string_split = func.split()\n       return string_split\n   return wrapper\n@splitter_decorator # this is executed next\n@lowercase_decorator # this is executed first\ndef hello():\n   return 'Hello World'\nhello()   # output => [ 'hello' , 'world' ] # decorator function to convert to lowercase def lowercase_decorator(function): def lowercase_decorator function def wrapper(): def wrapper return return # decorator function to split words def splitter_decorator(function): def splitter_decorator function def wrapper(): def wrapper return return @splitter_decorator # this is executed next @lowercase_decorator # this is executed first def hello(): def hello return 'Hello World' # output => [ 'hello' , 'world' ] The beauty of the decorators lies in the fact that besides adding functionality to the output of the method, they can even accept arguments for functions and can further modify those arguments before passing it to the function itself. The inner nested function, i.e. 'wrapper' function, plays a significant role here. It is implemented to enforce encapsulation and thus, keep itself hidden from the global scope. accept arguments inner nested function encapsulation # decorator function to capitalize names\ndef names_decorator(function):\n   def wrapper(arg1, arg2):\n       arg1 = arg1.capitalize()\n       arg2 = arg2.capitalize()\n       string_hello = function(arg1, arg2)\n       return string_hello\n   return wrapper\n@names_decorator\ndef say_hello(name1, name2):\n   return 'Hello ' + name1 + '!

        "question": "3. What is Scope Resolution in Python?",
        "answer": "Sometimes objects within the same scope have the same name but function differently. In such cases, scope resolution comes into play in Python automatically. A few examples of such behavior are: Python modules namely 'math' and 'cmath' have a lot of functions that are common to both of them - log10(), acos(), exp() etc. To resolve this ambiguity, it is necessary to prefix them with their respective module, like math.exp() and cmath.exp().\nConsider the code below, an object temp has been initialized to 10 globally and then to 20 on function call. However, the function call didn't change the value of the temp globally. Here, we can observe that Python draws a clear line between global and local variables, treating their namespaces as separate identities.

Python implements these namespaces as dictionaries with 'name as key' mapped to a corresponding 'object as value'. This allows for multiple namespaces to use the same name and map it to a separate object. A few examples of namespaces are as follows: Local Namespace includes local names inside a function. the namespace is temporarily created for a function call and gets cleared when the function returns.\nGlobal Namespace includes names from various imported packages/ modules that are being used in the current project. This namespace is created when the package is imported in the script and lasts until the execution of the script.\nBuilt-in Namespace includes built-in functions of core Python and built-in names for various types of exceptions.

        "question": "19. What is the difference between xrange and range in Python?",
        "answer": "xrange() and range() are quite similar in terms of functionality. They both generate a sequence of integers, with the only difference that range() returns a Python list, whereas, xrange() returns an xrange object. xrange() range() range() Python list xrange() xrange object So how does that make a difference? It sure does, because unlike range(), xrange() doesn't generate a static list, it creates the value on the go. This technique is commonly used with an object-type generator and has been termed as \"yielding\". So how does that make a difference? generator yielding Yielding is crucial in applications where memory is a constraint. Creating a static list as in range() can lead to a Memory Error in such conditions, while, xrange() can handle it optimally by using just enough memory for the generator (significantly less in comparison).

        "answer": "In Python, the assignment statement (= operator) does not copy objects. Instead, it creates a binding between the existing object and the target variable name.
