We can't store an address with a size larger than 16 bits using the near pointer. All other smaller addresses that are within the 16-bit limit, on the other hand, can be stored.

It can, however, use the current segment to access information stored outside the computer's memory.

Memory Complexity Constant, O(1) Maintain a head and a tail pointer on the merged linked list. Then choose the head of the merged linked list by comparing the first node of both linked lists. For all subsequent nodes in both lists, you choose the smaller current node and link it to the tail of the merged list, moving the current pointer of that list one step forward. You keep doing this while there are some remaining elements in both lists. If there are still some elements in only one of the lists, you link this remaining list to the tail of the merged list. Initially, the merged linked list is NULL. Compare the value of the first two nodes and make the node with the smaller value the head node of the merged linked list. In this example, it is 4 from head1. Since it\u2019s the first and only node in the merged list, it will also be the tail. Then move head1 one step forward. Conclusion C is the foundational language from which practically all other languages are built. C is the programming language's base. For writing system applications, it is a very popular and frequently used language. Even if new languages have surpassed it in popularity, it remains one of the most popular programming languages.
