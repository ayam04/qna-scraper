        "question": "2. What do you understand about web services? State some of the communication channels which are available for a web service.",
        "answer": "Web services are web components that allow clients and servers to exchange data. The client submits a web request to the server, which is subsequently responded to by the server. The response and the request are linked, and different requests elicit different responses. A web component or software program that can be accessed through the Internet is known as a web service. Through XML communications ideas, it is mostly used to communicate with web-based applications. For example, if we wish to utilize Google Maps to find a specific location, we can use the relevant web service's URL. To do so, we must provide the necessary inputs. In general, web services are used in conjunction with the protocols listed below: HTTP / POST: The HTTP / POST protocol is used to securely send data between clients.\nHTTP / GET: Clients can display sent data partially in the browser's address bar using the HTTP / GET protocol.\nSOAP: SOAP is a protocol for securely transmitting private data. HTTP / POST: The HTTP / POST protocol is used to securely send data between clients. HTTP / POST: HTTP / GET: Clients can display sent data partially in the browser's address bar using the HTTP / GET protocol.

        "question": "3. What do you understand about WSDL?",
        "answer": "WSDL: WSDL is an acronym for Web Services Description Language. It is connected to SOAP. It defines how the Web service works so that you may refer to it when you make a reference to it. The Web Services Description Language (WSDL) is an XML-based interface description language for specifying a web service's capabilities. Any specific WSDL description of a web service (also referred to as a WSDL file) that offers a machine-readable explanation of how the service can be called, what parameters it expects, and what data structures it returns is also referred to by the acronym. As a result, it serves a similar purpose to a type signature in a programming language. WSDL: Web Services Description Language   Services are described in the WSDL as groups of network endpoints or ports. For this reason, the WSDL definition specifies an XML format for documents. The abstract definitions of ports and messages are abstracted from their real application or instance, allowing them to be reused. A service is defined by associating a network address with a reusable binding, and a group of ports is formed by associating a network address with a reusable binding. Port types are abstract collections of supported operations, while messages are abstract descriptions of the data being exchanged. The concrete protocol and data format specifications for a specific port type comprise a reusable binding, which binds operations and messages to a specific network protocol and message format. WSDL describes the public interface to the Web service in this way.",

        "question": "5. What do you understand about XPath Assertion in SoapUI? Also, state your understanding of Data Driven Testing.",
        "answer": "The XPath assertion is used in SoapUI to assert the value of a web service response by specifying the absolute path. The test case or test suite will be marked as PASS if the absolute path matches the response value; otherwise, it will be marked as FAILED. The assertion results can be seen at the bottom of the screen in the Assertion tab. XPath assertion selects the target node and its values using an XPath expression. It compares an XPath expression's result to an expected value. XPath is an XML query language that allows you to pick nodes from an XML document. Given below are the steps which can be taken in order to add an XPath Assertion  in SoapUI: Select Assertion Category \u2013 Property Content after clicking Add Assertion.\nThen click Add and pick Assertion Type \u2013 XPath Match. The wizard for XPath Match Configuration appears. The NameSpace must be declared before an XPath may be added. An XML namespace is a set of names that are used as element and attribute names in XML documents and are identifiable by a URI reference. SoapUI XPath Assertion does the same thing.

SoapUI XPath Assertion does the same thing.   Click the 'Declare' button to automatically declare an XML Namespace; otherwise, manually declare a namespace.\nRefer to the XPath using the newly established namespace after declaring the namespace. When you click the 'Declare' button, two namespaces with two URIs will appear. The schema URL is one of them, while the real web service URL is the other. When accessing XPath, we must use the real namespace where the web service is situated, not the schema namespace. Click the 'Declare' button to automatically declare an XML Namespace; otherwise, manually declare a namespace. Refer to the XPath using the newly established namespace after declaring the namespace. When you click the 'Declare' button, two namespaces with two URIs will appear. The schema URL is one of them, while the real web service URL is the other.

Input the XPath of the XML node which needs to be checked. //ns1:ConversionRateResult gives the value of the node enclosed between <ConversionRateResult> and </ConversionRateResult> and ns1 stand for the declared namespace pointing to 'www.webserviceX.NET'.\nAfter inputting the XPath, click the 'Select from current' button to take up the value from the current answer for future comparison. The user has the ability to change the value.\nSave the file.

After inputting the XPath, click the 'Select from current' button to take up the value from the current answer for future comparison. The user has the ability to change the value. Save the file.   As demonstrated in the accompanying screenshot, the added assertion will be presented.   Data Driven testing entails storing our test data, which includes both input and expected output, in an external data source such as Excel, Database, or XML file. The data source must then be iterated using the appropriate component. For data-driven testing in SoapUI, the Datasource and Datasource Loop test steps are employed.",

In order to accomplish this, we can do the following steps: Create a project property that stores the endpoint.\nUsing property expansion, change the endpoint to use this property.\nAscertain that your requests use the configured endpoint.\nThe property will invariably be with its current value when a request is run. Simply configure the endpoint in the User Interface (UI) to use a different value, or use the P option from the command line. Create a project property that stores the endpoint.

A sample Test Step can include any number of assertions, each validating a particular element or content of the answer. The parts/all of the answer responses are compared to the expected outcome in assertions. Some of the important assertions present in SoapUI are as follows: WS security status: SoapUI manages WS Security configurations at the project level, allowing them to be utilised in several locations within a project:\nFor incoming and outgoing requests, as well as responses.\nIncoming MockServices requests and their MockResponses.\nIn the SOAP Monitor, for monitored requests and their monitored answers.

On the project level, there are four sub-tabs under the WS Security Configurations tab: Outgoing WS-Security Configurations: configurations for outgoing messages, such as requests and MockResponses. Encryption, signing and adding SAML, timestamp, and username headers are all done with this configuration type.\nWS Security Configurations for Incoming Messages: configurations that should be applied to incoming messages, such as responses, MockRequests, or monitored requests and responses. This configuration type is used to decode and validate incoming messages' signatures.\nKeystores: Encryption, decryption, and signature keys are stored in keystores.\nTruststores: Truststores used for signature verification.

XQuery Match: To pick information from the target property, XQuery employs an XQuery expression.

WCF (Windows Communication Foundation) is a core framework that allows you to create services with a web endpoint and deliver data using XML or JSON without using a SOAP wrapper. The steps to use SoapUI to test a WCF rest service are as follows: Clicking on File -> New SoapUI Project will start a new project. Fill in the blanks in the dialogue box, and do not forget to include the Initial WSDL parameter by adding the WCF URI.\nA new SoapUI project is created after clicking Ok.\nThen, much like the WCF Test Client, make the identical request.

From a high-level perspective, XML RPC and SOAP are extremely comparable protocols. Both use XML to encapsulate web service method requests and responses. XML RPC, on the other hand, can be thought of as a subset of SOAP capabilities.
