        "question": "1. How will you perform RPA Source Code Management?",
        "answer": "The backbone of every software development is source code management. To manage the code, a variety of VCS (Version Control Systems) are employed. VCS not only aids in the management of source code but also aids in the delivery of new code. Before you begin coding, make sure your VCSs are correctly established in the RPA control room. In the event of a system failure, version control systems can also aid in the recovery of your code.",

        "answer": "The same is embedded into the RPA on numerous levels. The good news is that with all vendors, the run time factor is completely distinct from the process of altering anything. It is not required for all users to have access to the same actions; in fact, they might be limited. This usually entails developing, designing, running, and editing processes. Every log that is made has the ability to provide complete information with a broad scope. When compared to a manual procedure, RPA gives you more control and security.",

        "answer": "The Robotic Process Automation (RPA) lifecycle gives structure to the automation process, allowing us to check that the deployment is going as planned at each stage. The stages are as follows:   Stage 1 \u2013 Identification: RPA strategists and architects work with business teams to define a business process for RPA development. The development is done in an agile and customizable manner.\nStage 2 \u2013 Analysis: The requirements of the client's processes are analysed and identified by a Process Architect. The degree of automation is determined by this study and the process's complexity. As a result, the advantages and outcomes of automation are immediately highlighted.\nStage 3 \u2013 Design: Process and Technical Architects generate PDDs (Process Definition Documents) based on requirement analysis, which describes the information for each step in each process. To better comprehend the flow of the process, develop an Object Model Diagram or a flowchart. After the flowchart is complete, the RPA tool that will automate the process is chosen.\nStage 4 \u2013 Development: Developers generate automation scripts and codes with the aid of specified RPA tools (UiPath, Blue Prism, etc.) and technologies, as well as the reference of Process Design Document (PDD), during the development process/phase.\nStage 5 \u2013 Testing: The testing team, which includes QA as part of the standard Systems Development Life Cycle, conducts post-development phase testing. Having a dedicated testing team to perform QA is the best approach. The bot is tested in a pre-production environment to confirm that it fulfils the need of automating a given task.\nStage 6 - Implementation: Unit testing should be carried out once all of the components have been assembled. To ensure a smooth integration, all of the components are checked. If any faults are discovered during diagnosis, the bot is returned to the development and testing teams for resolution.

        "answer": "No, that is not the case. Screen scraping is a technique used by programs to capture the contents of the screen. You process the data based on the information you've collected. Old technologies like screen scraping and macros have given way to robotic automation. This is because robots are universal application orchestrators, which means that any application that a man can use can be used by a modern-day robot, whether it's a mainframe, desktop application, legacy, or even a web service-enabled software. Robotic process automation is far more capable and reliable, and it can interface with Windows, Java, and web applications. When it comes to automating mainframes, RPA uses screen scraping, but that's simply a component of it; it has no bearing on RPA. RPA is a hybrid of the two technologies, with many additional capabilities and enhancements. RPA solutions provide a framework for automating end-to-end processes. Robots build up procedural knowledge, which eventually merges with a shared library that may be re-used by other robots or devices. The robot \"reads\" applications, either through supplied APIs if they exist, through the OS before the application appears, or through the screen in the case of native apps. In this scenario, the current robot \"reads\" an application screen in context, much like a human would.",

Organizations should seek assistance from Successful RPA Implementation Strategy and Consulting Services if they have not been cleared.\nRPA failing to receive instructions or memos: The RPA is only capable of obeying our provided instructions; it is incapable of learning new things on its own or responding to unforeseen events. As a result, we'll most likely witness an increase in the number of use cases where it's combined with modern technologies. When an RPA project or its bot encounters scenarios for which it was not trained or instructed, the project or bot fails.\nUnclear definition of RPA's use strategy: If a Cognitive RPA RPA project asks that a process be made more efficient, there is a risk that RPA will become a stand-alone business function without a solid plan in place. This is why RPA implementations go wrong in the long run. Creating a clear image of how RPA software is used so that it can fulfil the needs of a large number of people.\nSetting business expectations that aren't realistic: RPA is a tool that should not be used as the \"go-to\" solution for every issue.

        "question": "2. What are the various RPA Solution Architecture components?",
        "answer": "The architecture of RPA (Robotic Process Automation) is a crucial part of the RPA life cycle. The architecture of an RPA solution determines how well it is suited to the RPA solution you are designing. An RPA solution is a collection of tools, platforms, and infrastructure components that work together to provide a fully functional RPA tool or solution. As a result, all of these blocks are determined at the architect phase. So, RPA Architecture is made up of a number of different components. Let's take a look at each of these blocks one by one. RPA Tool - The RPA Tool that you will utilise should have the ability to automate applications for any environment, including online, desktop, and Citrix. Your RPA software's tools should be able to read and write from a variety of data sources. They'd have to create common application object stores or repositories in order to keep locators, therefore they should be able to do it.\nRPA Platform - A shared central repository where all software robots and resources developed using RPA tools are stored; it's best if it's in the cloud. RPA Platform can schedule, distribute, and monitor other software robots, as well as store all RPA software logs. The RPA platform serves as a central location for reusable components that are shared by different software robots.\nInfrastructure for RPA Execution - RPA execution infrastructure is a group of virtual or physical machines that may be resized down or up based on data patterns and are used to run software robots for attended or unattended process automation.\nConfiguration Management - When the RPA software version is critical, configuration management is used to ensure that software robots are regularly updated to newer versions. It's necessary to keep track of code versions and branching when numerous team members are working on shared components.\nOther Considerations - There are a number of RPA providers on the market who offer all of the components for RPA development as a single package. You should think about technologies or platforms that offer greater configuration management features.

        "answer": "Citrix automation refers to any automation system that uses a virtual desktop or is designed to work in virtual desktops. It is critical in small to large businesses, such as BPO and contact centres, where applications are accessible remotely due to security concerns. Consider a situation in which you need to connect to a server from your PC. When you try to access the server now, you don't receive the main server; instead, you get a picture of the server's screen. Now, anytime you click on something, the corresponding image or pixel is delivered to the server. Then it is precisely clicked over there in the server. Citrix technology and UiPath can be used to automate these kinds of processes. With the use of recorders, UiPath attempts to deliver this automation. Citrix automation is used to automate tasks like filling out a form and submitting it using a virtual desktop application. It can also be used for data entry and other processes.",

There are four possibilities for addressing errors in this activity: Rethrow - This action causes the robot to rethrow an exception that was previously caught while the workflow was being executed. We don't need to send any specific messages for this action.\nTerminate Workflow - This is a method that allows you to tell the robot to stop doing things. When there is no data to process, this activity is typically used. You may need to supply the exception message so that the bot can log the error in the error log file in order to use it. The developer/business can then refer to it to gain further information about the run.\nThrow - A technique in which a bot throws an error with a given error message if it fails to perform the requested action.

        "answer": "Because both the technology and the migration have a similar profile of highly structured, rules-based activities, robotic automation is an ideal fit for this task. A typical migration process, for example, follows this high-level extract, transform, and load (ETL) approach: Extract Design: A well-defined method for the extraction, storage, and verification of data is required.\nTransform: A migration design must specify how data will be converted in order to achieve the desired data structure.\nLoad: The specifics of how the extracted, converted and mapped data is mapped into the target structure must be established.\nTest and Recovery: Unit and integration test processes, reporting, and exit criteria, as well as roll-back and recovery procedures for each stage of the migration, must all be planned.

In less than a minute, you can set up REST Automation with UiPath's Request Builder Wizard. This allows you to configure the service's endpoint URL. Filling in the parameter names and values makes setting up parameters simple. The process also gives you the option of uploading an attachment and setting up advanced authentication if necessary. With just a click of a button, you may see the REST Response after setting up the service URL and relevant parameters. This allows you to make changes to the setup before completing the automation. Once the activity has been added to your workflow, you can further configure the HTTP Client. This gives you more options when it comes to data management. The Request Builder Wizard builds an activity that allows data to be transferred between web services and web browsers efficiently. This makes it even easier than putting together huge pages of code.

Use Automate to automate email as part of a larger organisational automation strategy. Let's look at some particular ways you can use RPA to save time with email. Initiation of tasks based on incoming email: Consider the duties you must complete as a result of receiving an email. In a customer-facing position, this can entail reporting order status. In other jobs, you can be responsible for generating sales or management reports. Email automation can handle a variety of activities that arrive in your mailbox without the need for manual intervention.\nAutomatic routing of attachments from incoming email: Whether it's an invoice, an archival receipt, an Excel report, or another sort of document, you may use RPA to recognise the attachment and process it according to rules. While Outlook automation is available, it is limited by the fact that it can only be used to file emails within Outlook. Your document or Excel could be filed in an EDMS or SharePoint by an RPA bot.\nAutomating outgoing email: The options for automating outgoing email are nearly limitless.

        "answer": "Despite its advantages, RPA poses certain security concerns. To do some piece of work or automated duties, such as logging into the system or moving data from one application to another, the RPA bot needed privileged access. Bots require credentials to accomplish these tasks, which are kept in a script or a rule-based process. There may be a process to retrieve these credentials from a different site. Because credentials are exchanged and reused so frequently, they are retained unmodified and stored in insecure areas. As a result, attackers can easily obtain RPA credentials and gain privileged access to computers. These security threats can be mitigated in the following ways: You should not save sensitive data in scripts or unsecured areas and should instead utilise some encrypted centralised locations to store these credentials.\nUse the idea of least privilege access for bots, which implies just giving bots access to the applications that they need.\nAdmins should secure the RPA console with credentials and monitor session activities, terminating the procedure if any suspicious sessions are discovered.
