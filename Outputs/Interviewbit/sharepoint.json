        "answer": "A list can contain up to 30 million items, and a library up to 30 million files and folders. When a list, library, or folder has more than 100,000 items, permission inheritance on the list, library, or folder cannot be broken. It also doesn't allow you to re-inherit permissions. However, up to the maximum number of unique permissions in the list or library, you can still break inheritance on individual objects within that list, library, or folder.",

        "question": "3. What are the important features of Microsoft SharePoint?",
        "answer": "Following are the most important features of Microsoft SharePoint:   Using SharePoint to collaborate: An intranet or internal website can be used to keep and communicate announcements, projects, tasks, calendars, and contact lists for usage within the organization. SharePoint also enables safe access because each user can be given varied permissions, such as edit or read-only access, based on the organization's needs. SharePoint may also be used as a central portal for information interchange and task collaboration, and the user experience can be customized for each user.\nSharePoint allows you to manage your content: SharePoint includes a robust content management tool that functions similarly to an electronic document library. Imagine all of the paper files packed in filing cabinets throughout many rooms, making it hard to discover anything without sifting through mountains of paper! SharePoint's electronic document management feature provides a central area for electronic files to be stored. By logging into the SharePoint site, members of an organization can also import documents so that files can be shared with all members. Members can also work on the same document collaboratively, make edits, and view revision history, allowing them to multitask in a mobile work environment.\nInsight into the business world: SharePoint allows users to read and edit Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files directly from a web browser, as well as use the sophisticated features of Microsoft Office apps. Excel's PowerPivot tool, for example, allows you to generate complicated computations, models, and reports. Instead of emailing files to each member of the group and waiting for them to edit and then email the final version to everyone, SharePoint's business intelligence tools allow you to create and share office documents with others in the organization. This is done securely and concurrently, ensuring that everyone has access to the same version of the document at all times.

        "question": "9. What do you understand by zones in the context of Microsoft SharePoint? What are the different types of zones available and what are the differences between them?",
        "answer": "Zones represent distinct logical pathways (URLs) to the same Web application. Zones allow you to set distinct access and policy requirements for various groups of users. There are a maximum of five zones per Web application. Following are the different types of zones available: Intranet\nInternet\nCustom\nExtranet\nExtranet Intranet Internet Custom Extranet Extranet The Default zone is generated when you create a Web application. The Web application can then be extended to create additional zones. Per Web application, each zone can only be selected once. In a Web application, for example, there can only be one Default zone. In Internet Information Services (IIS), each zone is represented by a separate Web site. The key distinction is that after extending SharePoint, each zone has its own IIS Website. These zones have unique URLs assigned to them. Each zone has its own port number and protocol (HTTP or HTTPS). In each zone, several authentication methods can be used to log in. For example, intranet forms authentication, default Windows authentication, and so on. For each zone, you configure your Blob and Distributed cache differently. For example - Assume you have a building, which is your Web Application, with a default zone as its main entrance and its own authentication service, such as Windows authentication in the front for SharePoint administrators, and adding other zones is similar to adding a few additional entrances to your Web Application with Facebook as the identity provider for your federated partners.

        "answer": "Following are the different types of forms used in Microsoft SharePoint\u2019s workflow : Association and Initiation forms:\nBefore each workflow begins, users are presented with association and initiation forms to complete. These forms can be used to allow users to set parameters and other information for the workflow ahead of time. Initiation forms discuss how the workflow relates to a specific SharePoint item, whereas association forms address how the workflow applies to a given list, library, or content category.\nAdministrators are presented with association forms when they initially select to associate a process with a specific list, document library, or content category. You can use association forms to allow an administrator to set workflow parameters, default values, and other information for items on the list, library, or content type with which the administrator is associating it.\nWhen users begin a workflow on a specific SharePoint item, they are presented with an initiation form. Initiation forms can be used to allow users to modify or append the association parameters provided by administrators, as well as to specify extra parameters or information about the workflow as it relates to a specific SharePoint item. Initiation forms aren't required for all workflows.\nThe initiation form and the association form can be the same. Using the same form for each workflow form, for example, allows administrators to define some default values during workflow association, then let the user who begins the workflow instance on a specific item review and replaces those default options.\nModification forms:\nYou might wish to give your users the ability to change the workflow while it's running on an item. For example, you could wish to give a user the ability to delegate a task to someone else or even add a new activity to the workflow. Modifications are the options you give users to adjust the process while it's executing on an item. You can construct modification forms that allow users to provide modification parameters.\nTask forms:\nFor each task in your process, you can provide custom forms. However, because tasks are SharePoint items with a content type assigned to them, the task type's custom forms are determined by the content type. All SharePoint task types are allocated content types by default. If a task type does not have a content type assigned to it, the task type is given the Task base content type. The WorkflowTask foundation content type must be used for all task-type content types. A content type's custom new, edit, and display forms can be specified.

This method can manage practically every aspect of a SharePoint Foundation object, including its life cycle. The workflow is adaptable enough to model both system functions and human actions required to complete the workflow. Workflows can be as simple or as complex as required by your business processes. You can construct workflows that the user starts or workflows that SharePoint Foundation initiates automatically based on an event, such as the creation or modification of an object.

        "answer": "The 5,000 view restriction on the document library was introduced by Microsoft with SharePoint 2010 for one reason: to keep the document library and its servers running smoothly. When the limit was reached in the past, the traditional library became unusable. However, SharePoint can now handle massive amounts of data thanks to Microsoft's modern interface and new document library. Even though you can now upload more than 20,000 papers without the library freezing, the browsing limit remains. Let's imagine you have a document library with 10,000 files in it, all of them are in the same folder. You won't be able to see more than 5,000 items on the page if you go to that library because the query will hit the limit. A large document library will cause you trouble in addition to not being able to see all of the contents. The majority of operations, such as renaming a folder or moving files within the library, will take a long time. Following are the different ways in which you can fix the 5000 item limit threshold issue in Microsoft SharePoint : Reduce the number of items to under 5,000.\nThe first step is to reduce the number of items in your inventory down below the item viewing threshold. When the number of items in your library hits that limit, you will be unable to create trivial actions in your library.\nYou won't be able to do any of the following:\nManage column indexes\nAdd columns\nAdjust the views\nSet permissions Reduce the number of items to under 5,000.\nThe first step is to reduce the number of items in your inventory down below the item viewing threshold.

Manage column indexes\nAdd columns\nAdjust the views\nSet permissions Manage column indexes Add columns Adjust the views Set permissions This prevents you from doing the following fixes, thus the first thing you need to do is \"unlock\" your library so you can continue working on it. Reorganize Your Library in Its Entirety\nYou can organize your items by moving them into separate libraries and categorizing them based on business functions. You can, on the other hand, delete items that are no longer useful. You'll run across this problem again in the near future unless you reorganize your entire library. As a result, you must follow solid organizational procedures and make use of as many libraries as possible.\nMetadata Properties are created.\nIt's time to build metadata properties and apply default column values to folders in your current library after you've reorganized everything. Give as much information as possible about each item you have. You can now index columns after you've done that. As previously said, this allows your server to query the index catalogs rather than search each item. This method is more efficient and will put less strain on the server. You can, on the other hand, choose to conceal specific folders entirely from view. Some people don't require access to particular folders, so you can set it up to conceal it from them or limit the number of items they can see.

        "question": "3. What is the default lookup column limit in Microsoft SharePoint lists? How can you increase the lookup column limit in Microsoft SharePoint?",
        "answer": "The default lookup column limit in Microsoft SharePoint is 12. Workflow status columns, classic lookup columns to other lists, and person/group columns are all examples of lookup columns. The two default people fields \"Created by\" and \"Modified by\" are included in this. If you have more than 12 of them in your list, you may get the following error: \"The number of search and workflow status columns in this view exceeds the administrator-imposed threshold (12) and cannot be displayed.\" Following steps should be followed to increase the threshold limit of the lookup column in SharePoint lists : Navigate to Central Admin.\nSelect Manage Web Apps from the drop-down menu. Navigate to Central Admin. Select Manage Web Apps from the drop-down menu.   Select the web app for which the lookup limit is being increased. Select the web app for which the lookup limit is being increased.   Under \"General Settings,\" select \"Resource Throttling\" from the drop-down arrow.

A single line of text, a drop-down list of possibilities, a number calculated from other columns, and a column that allows you to pick a person's name are all examples of column kinds. Following steps can be followed to add a column in a list in Microsoft SharePoint: Go to the list or library where you want to add a column.\nSelect + Add column or + to the right of the last column name at the top of the list or library.\nChoose the type of column you want from the dropdown menu.\nEnter a title or column header in the Name field of the Create a column panel.

SharePoint can also restore erased history or document or file modifications by enabling versioning, which allows it to trace the history and determine which document or item has been changed. It can also be used to restore past versions of SharePoint libraries or lists.\nThis lacks a public-facing site publishing feature, as well as a chat feature, which Atlassians are working on.

        "question": "7. What do you understand about add-ins in the context of Microsoft SharePoint?",
        "answer": "A SharePoint Add-in is a self-contained piece of functionality that expands SharePoint websites' capabilities to tackle a specific business need. Custom code that runs on SharePoint servers is not present in add-ins. Instead, all custom logic is moved \"up\" to the cloud, \"down\" to client computers, or \"over\" to an on-premises server that is not part of the SharePoint farm or subscription. SharePoint administrators may rest assured that the add-in will neither harm their servers or degrade the performance of their SharePoint Online websites by keeping custom code off of them. One of the various client APIs offered in SharePoint allows business logic in a SharePoint Add-in to access SharePoint data. Which API you pick for your add-in is determined by a number of additional design considerations. A SharePoint Add-in can include almost all major types of SharePoint components, such as pages, lists, workflows, custom content types, list templates, web parts, and more. Host webs are SharePoint websites on which SharePoint Add-ins are installed and from which users launch them. The SharePoint components, on the other hand, are usually located in an add-in web, which is a specific child web of the host web.

        "question": "8. What do you understand about team sites and communication sites in the context of Microsoft SharePoint? When should you use a team site and when should you use a communication site?",
        "answer": "  Team Site: A SharePoint team site provides access to shared material and resources for you and your colleagues. Use team sites to save and collaborate on files, as well as to construct and manage information lists. They can also be used for the following:\nTo keep track of the project's progress and keep informed.\nTo organize and co-author content that is shared.\nTo gain access to team resources, join a Microsoft 365 group.\nCases where you should use a team site:\nA Team Site is used when you want to create a location where members of a workgroup or project team may collaborate on project deliverables, plan an event, track status, or share ideas. All participants of a Team Site are content authors, and we develop and edit content together. Consider team locations to be a place where work is completed. Our project team requires a space where they may collaborate on deliverables. Even though we each have our own tasks, we are all working together to generate one or more assets. A Team Site is required for our project team.\nCommunication Site: A SharePoint communication site is an excellent location for spreading information. In a visually appealing style, distribute news, reports, status updates, and more. To engage and inform a large audience, use communication sites. They can also be used for the following:\nTo create sites for certain departments, projects, or portals.\nTo share corporate news, events, and announcements.\nHundreds, if not thousands, of people can be involved.\nCases where you should use a communication site:\nA Communication Site is used when you wish to \"broadcast\" a message, tell a story, publish material for viewing (but not editing) to a big audience or the entire organization, or highlight services or people.

        "question": "9. Differentiate between Microsoft SharePoint and Microsoft Onedrive.",
        "answer": "Onedrive: OneDrive is a cloud-based document and file storage service. Individuals and corporate teams who require a central area to store and retrieve files generally use it. Versioning and sharing tools in OneDrive make it simple to collaborate, so it's more than just an online filing cabinet. Microsoft separates the tool into personal and work or school versions; for the sake of this essay, we'll concentrate on the work or school version.\nSharePoint: SharePoint is a collaboration solution that allows several people and teams to work on documents and products at the same time. Microsoft has integrated SharePoint into their Microsoft 365 cloud platform (formerly known as Office 365) over the last few years with improvements to their Microsoft 365 product (previously known as Office 365).

        "question": "10. What do you understand about SharePoint farm?",
        "answer": "  Simply said, a SharePoint farm is a group of servers that collaborate to fill SharePoint responsibilities and make SharePoint function. If you're unfamiliar with the concept, consider roles to be separate jobs that each demand specific talents. When you're ready to install SharePoint, you assign one or more roles to each server on your farm. A team working together toward the same objective is a good illustration of roles. Consider a restaurant staff. In a restaurant, the host seats customers, the waiter takes their orders and eventually delivers their meal, and the kitchen crew prepares the food. If the host is removed, the patron will never be seated. When a waiter is lost, the customer is unable to place an order, eat, or simply receive a poor glass of water. Of course, one person may fulfil all of those tasks \u2014 for example, at a small coffee shop, where the person behind the counter takes your order, advises you to sit wherever you choose, and then butters and delivers your toast. This only works if the venue isn't too crowded since that one individual would quickly become overwhelmed. Your farm servers operate in the same way, with a single server capable of performing all duties or spreading them across numerous servers for improved performance. There are three roles in SharePoint (formally defined in the SharePoint installation wizard alongside a few new roles in SharePoint Server 2016). three roles They are as follows: The Web Front End (WFE), Application Server, and Database Server.",
